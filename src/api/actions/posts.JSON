			"rendered": "\n<p>Born in Elizabethtown, Kentucky, Denisha Montgomery was a 27-year-old mother raising her three young sons in Hodgenville. She had always been interested in forensics and in January 2021, she enlisted in the army, following other family members. She was also determined to create a better life for her husband Joshua Smith and their three sons.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"455\" height=\"284\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/dm-photo.jpeg?resize=455%2C284&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4066\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/dm-photo.jpeg?w=455&amp;ssl=1 455w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/dm-photo.jpeg?resize=417%2C260&amp;ssl=1 417w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 455px) 100vw, 455px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Denisha Montgomery (k105.com)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Denisha was deployed to Germany in 2022 for a 9-month rotation with the 139th Military Police Company at Fort Stewart. In May of the same year, she was stationed in Wiesbaden, Germany, and set to return home to the United States in September.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>She was perfect, always a leader, always there for everybody&#8230; She just wanted us to be proud of her. And we were absolutely proud of her, everything she did.</p>\n<cite>Joshua Smith, widower of Denisha Montgomery (wdrb.com)</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Denisha&#8217;s time in the army quickly took a turn for the worse when on July 19, 2022, she video-called her family back home. Denisha requested her family record the call and for the next 12 minutes, she frantically retold her family what had happened to her that day. On her day off, she had gone to an off-base water park with four fellow soldiers in her unit. They had been drinking that day and on the car ride home, she was assaulted and strangled by them. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>They choked me out, I kept telling them, I can&#8217;t breathe. I was like, I can&#8217;t breathe! I was gasping for air. I ain&#8217;t never been so scared in my life. I legit thought I was going to die in the car&#8230;I can&#8217;t be here no more. I don&#8217;t trust them. I don&#8217;t trust my leadership. I don&#8217;t want to be here with none of them no more.</p>\n<cite>Denisha Montgomery to her family during a video call (armytimes.com)</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<iframe style=\"width:100%; height:400px;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uu0adC2J__4\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n\n\n\n<p>During the video call (can be seen in the video above), Denise showed her family the bruising on her body from the attack and told them that the next day she was going to report the attack to Army\u2019s Criminal Investigation Division (CID). Her family immediately contacted The Red Cross and reported the incident. The next day, Denise messaged her uncle to tell him that her conversation with the CID did not go well and that if she reported the assault she would also be charged with assault as well &#8211; for fighting back and hitting and biting the male and female who were assaulting her. She told her uncle that she ended up not reporting the incident as she didn&#8217;t want to get in trouble. To draw attention away from her situation she kept mostly to herself, stayed in her room, and went to work while waiting to return to Stewart where she may have had the opportunity to transfer to another squad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Twenty-one days after the attack on August 21, 2022, Denisha Montgomery was found unresponsive at Lucius Clay Barracks and pronounced dead at the scene. The Army contacted Denisha&#8217;s family shortly after her death during preliminary findings and before autopsy results, to inform them that Denisha had most likely taken her own life and died of suicide.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>They said, we\u2019re sorry to inform you that your daughter has committed suicide by suffocation. And I said, How do you suffocate yourself. How can you possibly suffocate yourself?</p>\n<cite>Heather Montgomery, mother of Denisha Montgomery (everythinglubbock.com)</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Denisha&#8217;s entire family firmly believes she would never have killed herself. Despite the Army declaring Denisha&#8217;s death a suicide, they also say they are actively investigating her death and following all possible leads. However, to this date, the Army has not contacted the family once to ask about a possible assault. They have also granted a no-contact order for all the individuals in the car with Denisha, barring them from having any contact with her family. The CID did, however, give them a conflicting story about the events of the night she was assaulted. They claimed that on that night at the water park two individuals, who were not part of Denisha&#8217;s group, tried to sexually assault her in a restroom. The people in her group, whom Denishia said assaulted her, tried to help her by chasing the assailants away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The family has now taken matters into their own hands and hired attorney Lindsey Knapp to help them look into the case.</p>\n",

		"content": {
			"rendered": "\n<p>Alicia Navarro was a 14-year-old girl living in Glendale, Arizona with her younger sister and brother, father Ivan, and mother Jessica Nu\u00f1ez before she disappeared. Alicia was known as a sweet and simple girl. From a young age, she had advanced sensory abilities and learned to tie her shoes and do laundry. She was also very smart with electronics and enjoyed spending most of her time playing video games such as Minecraft and Roadblocks. She loved to wear sweatshirts even in the Arizona heat and go to McDonald&#8217;s to get her favorite order of chicken nuggets. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"491\" height=\"549\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/alicia-navarro-photo.jpg?resize=491%2C549&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3978\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/alicia-navarro-photo.jpg?w=491&amp;ssl=1 491w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/alicia-navarro-photo.jpg?resize=233%2C260&amp;ssl=1 233w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 491px) 100vw, 491px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Alicia Navarro (azcentral.com)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Alicia attended Bourgade Catholic High School in Phoenix and described herself as &#8220;introverted, nerdy, shy&#8221; on her first day of school. Life was not always easy for Alicia, however, as she had to take medications, had a compromised immune system, and was diagnosed with autism. She was high-functioning on the autism spectrum but her family still hired a behavior coach to help her through the challenges she faced from being in a school environment. She had a small group of childhood friends as well as her many online gaming friends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Friday, September 13, 2019, Alicia asked her mother, Jessica, if she could skip school and her mother agreed, reasoning that she was feeling nervous. Alicia spent most of that day in her room. On Saturday, she spent the day with her mother, getting her eyebrows threaded and visiting a chocolate factory. Jessica remembered her daughter as being very happy that day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Sunday night, September 15, at approximately 1:00 am, Jessica was waiting for her husband, Ivan, to get off work when Alicia walked downstairs to get a glass of water. Seeing Alicia up late at night was not new to her mother as she knew Alicia often stayed up late to play video games and talk to her online gaming friends. Alicia asked her mother what time she was going to bed before she headed back upstairs to her room. At some point during the night after her husband returned home, the two went to bed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next morning, at around 7:00 am, Jessica was up making breakfast for her family. Ivan and Alicia&#8217;s younger brother and sister were up, but Alicia was not up yet. While putting together the food, Jessica noticed that the back door to the house was slightly ajar. She went out to the yard to make sure nothing was amiss but soon discovered that someone had moved and stacked several of the chairs in the yard against the back wall. There were also shoe prints near the chairs that appeared to be the same size as Alicia&#8217;s. Jessica suspected that the chairs had been stacked to help her daughter jump over the wall. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jessica went to Alicia&#8217;s room, but her room was empty and Alicia was nowhere to be found; on Alicia&#8217;s desk there was a note to her parents that read: &#8220;I ran away. I will be back. I swear. I\u2019m sorry.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"590\" height=\"331\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/letter.png?resize=590%2C331&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3969\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/letter.png?w=590&amp;ssl=1 590w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/letter.png?resize=463%2C260&amp;ssl=1 463w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Handwritten note from Alicia to her parents (Glendale Police Department)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Alicia&#8217;s laptop was also gone, but not the chargers. Jessica immediately called the police to inform them of Alicia&#8217;s disappearance. Police arrived at the home to search the house, but did not find anything else unusual.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Five days later, on September 20, 2019, Alicia turned fifteen years old. She did not make any contact with her family or friends and her social media was not active. Jessica believes that someone from one of Alicia&#8217;s online gaming communities convinced her to meet, and then kept her from returning home.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>I just feel like she\u2019s in danger. She would have never been gone this long &#8211; not without getting in touch with me. Someone has her and I\u2019m so worried.</p>\n<cite>Jessica Nu\u00f1ez, mother of Alicia Navarro</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As police actively work the case, Jessica continues to keep Alicia&#8217;s story alive in the news by doing interviews, which have led to two tips about her possible whereabouts. The first tip was from a woman who claimed to have seen Alicia walking with a man holding hands at a location approximately ten minutes from Alicia&#8217;s and her family&#8217;s home. The second tip came in from another woman claiming to have seen Alicia in the same area. The tips unfortunately did not lead to any breakthroughs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Glendale Police Department still does not know for sure whether Alicia was lured away or if she left on her own accord and is actively searching for her with the assistance of the FBI and the Center for Missing and Exploited Children. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>An age-progressed photo of Alicia at the age of 17 has also been released.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/alicia-age-progressed.png?resize=393%2C524&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Alicia Navarro\" class=\"wp-image-3983\" width=\"393\" height=\"524\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/alicia-age-progressed.png?w=768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/alicia-age-progressed.png?resize=195%2C260&amp;ssl=1 195w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 393px) 100vw, 393px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Alicia Navarro as a 17-year-old (childfindofamerica.org)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>To date, this case is still unsolved and police are actively searching for Alicia. </p>\n",

		"content": {
			"rendered": "\n<p>In 1995, Quin-Rong Wu immigrated to the United States from the Guangdong Province in southern China with her parents, 17-year-old sister, and 7-year-old brother. The family settled in the Lower East Side in a second-floor apartment at 199 Henry Street. Quin&#8217;s father, Qun Shen Wu, found work at a noodle factory, and her mother, Wu Yu Qin, worked as a seamstress on Canal street. The family of five lived in an old tenement building in a small one-bedroom, two-room apartment. The five of them shared two beds, Quin-Rong and her sister in one bed, and her brother and parents in the other. Quin-Rong&#8217;s school, Public School 2, was located just down the block from their apartment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Quin-Rong&#8217;s childhood in China was difficult because she did not actually live with her parents. In order to circumvent China&#8217;s one-child policy at the time, she lived an hour away with relatives. The move to America would be the first time she was able to live with her entire family. Although she struggled to learn English and acclimate to life in an America, Quin-Rong was known to enjoy school and eagerly went an hour early each morning where she was served a breakfast of muffins and cereal. She enjoyed hide-and-seek, playing with her family&#8217;s Game Boy, and visiting the nearby park. She loved all things American and was known to prefer pancakes and cereal over traditional Chinese food.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>She liked school. She liked New York City. She was very happy.</p>\n<cite>Hua-Rong Wu, sister of Quin-Rong Wu</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>On the morning of Tuesday, May 13, Quin-Rong put on her jeans, a sweatshirt, and her red sneakers, and left her apartment with her mother. The two of them walked halfway to school together before Quin-Rong walked the last hundred yards to her school alone. She never made it to school that day. After the school notified her family that she wasn&#8217;t at school, they frantically searched the Lower East Side streets to no avail. When Quin-Rong could still not be found, they alerted the Seventh Precinct police.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An extensive search was soon underway with help from the police, Chinese community, and family, but nothing was ever discovered in that initial period. Two weeks after Quin-Rong went missing, the body of a young girl was found Wednesday evening just north of the Manhattan Bridge in the East River. Police also found a single red sneaker. The body and face of the girl were badly decomposed and bloated from being in the water for so long. It was not until dental records were used to identify the body that police knew the body belonged to Quin-Rong. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cause of death was determined to be manual strangulation, police did not make any other signs of trauma known to the public. The police investigation has uncovered varying witness accounts leading to a number of different narratives of what could have happened that day. One witness reported seeing a caucasian, bearded, man with a crying Asian girl boarding a northbound subway in the Lower East Side one hour after Quin-Rong would have left her mother. The same witness saw the pair again later that day boarding a different train going from Manhattan to Brooklyn. Other witnesses claimed to have seen a caucasian man staring at young girls near Quin-Rong&#8217;s school.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her family has also come under suspicion as well, when it was later discovered that the family had another daughter who had died in China. Police became suspicious of this because both parents gave different stories as to the cause of her death. Police were also surprised that the family never inquired about case updates. When asked about it, Quin-Rong&#8217;s father stated that he did not even know that was a possibility. Around the time of her disappearance, police were also actively searching for a serial rapist in Chinatown who was known to have raped multiple young girls around the same age as Quin-Rong, although no formal connection was ever made by police.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To date, this case is still unsolved, and Quin-Rong&#8217;s family eventually moved out of the Lower East side &#8211; their whereabouts are currently unknown.</p>\n",

			"rendered": "\n<p>Immaculate Basil was born on December 8, 1985, and was part of the Tl&#8217;azt&#8217;en Nation in Tachie, south of the Kuz Che Reserve in British Columbia. She was named by her father in honor of the Virgin Mary and was also known to friends and family as &#8220;Mackie.&#8221; She grew up in a large family and was one of eight siblings. Mackie did not have the easiest childhood as she grew up in foster care and she and her sister experienced abuse from their foster parents. Despite living apart, she and her sisters Ida and Crystal would call each other daily. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"400\" height=\"475\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/immaculate-basil-pic.jpg?resize=400%2C475&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3745\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/immaculate-basil-pic.jpg?w=400&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/immaculate-basil-pic.jpg?resize=219%2C260&amp;ssl=1 219w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Immaculate Basil (RSCMP Missing Persons)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>When Mackie graduated high school, she got out of foster care and moved to the reservation. She lived with her partner and soon gave birth to a son. Mackie was a devoted mother who loved kids and even fostered some of the kids on the reservation. She worked several jobs as a part-time secretary, teacher&#8217;s assistant, and house cleaner. Mackie eventually split with her long-time partner. The reason for their separation was not known to her family and she moved in with her brother and sister.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>She took a lot in because of her past and held that in and didn\u2019t show it, so she was always happy and did stuff for other people. She was just a very loving and caring and bubbly person even though she went through a lot of hard times.</p>\n<cite>Ida Basil, sister of Immaculate Basil (Longreads)</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>On Thursday, June 13, 2013, Mackie and her brother and sister went to a nearby community to buy groceries and run errands. At the store, she asked her brother Peter to buy her 2 bottles of vodka because she had lost her ID. She wanted the bottles for a party she planned to attend later that night. After they returned home and just before dusk, Mackie grabbed one bottle of vodka and her iPod and headed out to where locals were having a party. Her sister Vivian was watching her son for the night. Mackie returned home a few hours later and grabbed the second bottle of vodka and headed up a trail called Leo Creek Forest Service Road to a cabin right outside of town to continue the party. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was shortly after midnight when Mackie headed to the second party and the events of the night after that are not entirely clear. She was said to have been with two men that night: her younger cousin Keith and a 48-year-old man named Victor. A forestry worker reported seeing a woman that resembled Mackie the next morning at approximately 9:30 am. She saw a woman walking alone along a bridge away from a truck that had gotten in an accident. She saw two men with the truck. Some people suspect that Mackie tried to hitchhike home after the truck had gotten stuck. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Mackie did not show up to pick up her son the next day, or the days after, her family reported her missing to the police. They began to call family and friends to see if anyone had seen her. It was not a common occurrence for her to spend the night away from her son, and she had no overnight supplies or a cell phone with her. The area the cabin was located in was also known to have no cell phone coverage. Despite several days of searching by police and community members, nothing was ever found.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two men Mackie was seen with that night told her sister Vivian that she had caught a ride with someone else. Police confiscated the truck she was in but no evidence was found to suspect foul play.  Her previous partner was also questioned and even though he left town shortly after her disappearance, they cleared him as a suspect as he had an alibi. Victor, one of the men who Mackie had hung out with at the party, was spotted the same morning she went missing walking into town around 10 am with his clothes wet up to his chest. Witnesses found his appearance odd, in addition to the fact that he arrived in town so shortly after the accident occurred. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite this odd occurrence, and his record of multiple violent crimes, including one for sexual assault, Victor was interviewed by police and passed a polygraph test, so police ruled him out as a suspect. Keith, her younger cousin who she also spent the night with, was also interviewed by police and passed a polygraph test. Neither man has ever talked to Mackie&#8217;s family about the exact events of that night. Although police have looked into several people, it has been difficult to name anyone as a suspect because there is no crime scene. Mackie was 27 years old when she went missing, and her son was five years old. This case remains unsolved and her family is still searching for answers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://thehueandcry.com/highway-of-tears\">View more cases from the Highway of Tears</a>.</p>\n",

			"rendered": "\n<p>Jean Virginia Sampare, who also went by Ginny, was of Gitxsan descent and was the second youngest of six children. Ginny was known as a shy and quiet child who loved to play nurse with her siblings. When she was older, she attended high school in Hazleton, B.C., and during the fishing season, she worked at the Royal Packing Company salmon canning plant in Claxton. Ginny often acted as the caretaker for her siblings, especially when their father drank too much. Her siblings remembered her as strong and responsible, she always let them know of her plans and never left unannounced. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Thursday night, October 14, 1971, Ginny and her cousin Alvin were hanging out near an old bridge on Highway 16 that was located right outside their hometown of Gitsegukla. As the night grew colder, Alvin wanted to get a jacket so he hopped on his bicycle and told Ginny that he would be right back. His house was located nearby the bridge. On his way back he said he heard a car door slam and when he arrived back at the spot where they had parted ways, Ginny was nowhere to be seen. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her mother reported her missing the next day and police, family, and community members searched for her in the following days but nothing was ever found. Her brother&#8217;s wife remembered seeing Ginny at her mother&#8217;s house that night, and she appeared upset before quickly leaving the house. Ginny was also dating someone who worked at the cannery at that time, and he had gone missing just days before her own disappearance. Her family strongly believes that even though she was stressed at the time, it was not in her nature to run away from home or take her own life. This case is still unsolved and Ginny has not been seen or heard from since that night.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://thehueandcry.com/highway-of-tears\">View more cases from the Highway of Tears</a>.</p>\n",

She was seen walking by herself along Highway 16 in the direction of her house. She was wearing a blue wool duffle coat, blue socks, and brown Wallabee-style shoes. She never made it home that night, however.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On April 6, approximately 4 months later, her body was found 6 km northeast of Terrace off of a densely-wooded services road known as Celgar. Her body was decomposed and partially clothed, and police determined that she had been strangled by her own clothing. Two witnesses also reported seeing a car containing a man and what appeared to be a small girl pull over to the side of the road the night of her disappearance. To date, no arrests have been made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since Monica&#8217;s death, an RCMP Task Force called E-PANA was created to investigate the series of unsolved murders along this highway, including Monica&#8217;s. The purpose of the task force was &#8220;to determine if a serial killer, or killers, is responsible for murdering young women traveling along major highways in BC&#8221; (<a href=\"https://bc-cb.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/ViewPage.action?siteNodeId=23&amp;languageId=1&amp;contentId=27048\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">E-PANA website</a>).

			"rendered": "\n<p>Micheline Pare was five-foot-four with brown hair, a dimple on her chin, and wearing blue flare cords when she went missing. She was 18 years old and originally from Quebec but was in the Hudson&#8217;s Hope area in British Columbia at the time of her disappearance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Micheline was seen hitchhiking through the area, which was a common method of transportation during that time. According to police reports, two women had picked her up and dropped her off at the gates of Tompkins Ranch on Highway 20 which is between Fort St. John and Hudson\u2019s Hope.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On August 8, 1970, Micheline&#8217;s body was found approximately 21 km away. A group of people who were picking berries along the highway discovered her body. Police determined that she had been beaten with a blunt weapon and although her body was too badly decomposed to confirm, they also believed she had been sexually assaulted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Police circulated a photo of Micheline throughout the area in order to generate leads or information but no arrests were ever made. Since Micheline&#8217;s death, an RCMP Task Force called E-PANA was created to investigate the series of unsolved murders along this highway, including Micheline&#8217;s. The purpose of the task force was &#8220;to determine if a serial killer, or killers, is responsible for murdering young women traveling along major highways in BC&#8221; (<a href=\"https://bc-cb.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/ViewPage.action?siteNodeId=23&amp;languageId=1&amp;contentId=27048\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">E-PANA website</a>).

She was 27 years old and the mother of two children, ages three and four. &#8220;She was a really very happy person, very fun-loving and always trying to help people. She basically cared for us, me and my younger sisters, while my mother worked,&#8221; recalled her brother Dave Moody. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the weekend of October 25, 1969, Gloria was on a road trip with her family and she and her brother made plans to go into town for a night out. The two had gone to several bar establishments that night including The Lakeview, The Maple Leaf, and Ranch Hotel.&nbsp;Ranch Hotel was the last bar the two visited. Ready to call it a night, Dave left the bar to head back to his hotel room. He assumed his sister was right behind him, but when he turned back to speak to her, she was nowhere to be seen. He does not know what happened after that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next day, two hunters were on a cattle trail that was approximately 10 km west of Williams Lake when they saw the body of a woman in the bush. The body was soon identified by police to belong to Gloria. She had been stripped naked, with her clothes discarded nearby, beaten, and sexually assaulted. She had bled to death from her injuries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No one has ever been arrested for the murder of Gloria. Gloria is widely believed to be the first known case of the Highway of Tears. Since her death, an RCMP Task Force called E-PANA was created to investigate the series of unsolved murders along this highway, including Gloria&#8217;s. The purpose of the task force was &#8220;to determine if a serial killer, or killers, is responsible for murdering young women traveling along major highways in BC&#8221; (<a href=\"https://bc-cb.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/ViewPage.action?siteNodeId=23&amp;languageId=1&amp;contentId=27048\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">E-PANA website</a>).

			"rendered": "\n<p>Jessica Patrick, who also used the last name Balczer, was a member of the Lake Babine Nation. She did not have an easy childhood growing up. At the age of seven, her family was split up and she was placed into foster care. For the next several years she moved between foster homes and her extended family. At the age of 14, Jessica was finally placed back with her father. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"370\" height=\"540\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/jessica-patrick.jpeg?resize=370%2C540&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3639\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/jessica-patrick.jpeg?w=370&amp;ssl=1 370w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/jessica-patrick.jpeg?resize=178%2C260&amp;ssl=1 178w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 370px) 100vw, 370px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Jessica Patrick Balczer (Abbotsford News)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Her father remembered her as &#8220;happy, vivacious and spiritual,&#8221; a girl who was outgoing, who believed in Jesus, loved Marilyn Monroe, and makeup. Despite all her struggles growing up, Jessica&#8217;s cousin Jacquie Bowes also remembered her as bubbly and goofy and someone who loved her family. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>She&#8217;s been in survival mode her whole entire life. She never let other people in on her misery. She was always trying to uplift others.</p>\n<cite>Jacquie Bowes, cousin of Jessica Patrick Balczer</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>At the age of 17, Jessica had a daughter named Alayah. The two were inseparable and Jacquie recalled, &#8220;her daughter was the diamond in her eyes. She wanted to give her daughter the life that she didn&#8217;t have.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On August 31, 2018, Jessica gave her daughter Alayah a long hug goodbye before she left for the night. She planned on going to a party at the Mountain View Motel with friends, while her grandmother watched over Alayah. When she did not return to pick up her daughter that night or the next day, her family reported her missing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last known sighting of Jessica was the night of August 31 at the Mountain View Motel located on Highway 16. There was a large party at the motel and police were eventually called in to handle a fight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Police initially told family members that Jessica was probably out partying with friends and that she would return soon. Feeling that police were not taking the case seriously enough, Jessica&#8217;s family conducted their own search party. Family members spent several days driving between towns and putting up posters, looking for any signs of Jessica. On September 6, police finally put out a news release on her. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>A lot of people just thought she was out\u00a0partying, but\u00a0that wasn&#8217;t the case. Not Jessica. She always stayed in touch with her daughter. She always found Wi-Fi&#8221;.</p>\n<cite>Jacquie Bowes, cousin of Jessica Patrick Balczer</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>On September 15, family members were searching the top of Hudson&nbsp;Bay Mountain when they spotted a body 15 meters down on a slippery embankment. The body was found next to a discarded washing machine. Long dark hair covered her face and she was in the clothes that Jessica had worn that night: a white tank top and ballerina flats. Police later confirmed that the body belonged to Jessica.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>RCMP have stated that this is still an active case and they are looking into any leads, although family members feel they are doing most of the work themselves. To date, no arrests have been made.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Why aren\u2019t they doing anything anymore? It is hard for all of us knowing if we will get justice or not.</p>\n<cite>Floyd Hyzins, husband of Jessica Patrick Balczer&#8217;s sister</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://thehueandcry.com/highway-of-tears\">View more cases from the Highway of Tears</a>.</p>\n",

The reason for the visit was unknown, but Silene would often walk around her neighborhood and stop and chat with different neighbors. Unfortunately, she was never seen or heard from again after she left her house that evening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Around 5:00 am on Saturday, April 17, 2004, firemen responded to a call of a small brush fire in Southern Richland County near Montgomery Lane and Pincushion Road, just off Highway 378. While putting out the fire, the body of a teenage girl was discovered lying face down. The girl had been severely beaten and investigators believed the victim was still alive when she was set on fire as soot was found in her lungs. Investigators also believe she knew the person who killed her, and that she was set on fire to destroy any evidence.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The body was identified as Silene through dental records, and a necklace with a charm of a shoe or boot was found around her neck, identical to one Silene owned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To date, no suspects have been arrested and the case is still considered unsolved.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>We are very close to solving this if we can just get that other shred of evidence or testimony.</p>\n<cite>Gene Mincey, investigator on Silene Eaddy case</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>*This case was created in partnership with <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://uncovered.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Uncovered</a>: Cold Case Files for Murdered or Missing People. <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://uncovered.com/cases/silene-eaddy\" target=\"_blank\">Read this case on their site for more information.</a></p>\n",

			"rendered": "\n<p>Alberta Williams was a member of the Gitksan Tribe from Gitanyow, British Columbia. Alberta lived a relatively quiet life during her childhood; her father Lawrence drove logging trucks and her mother Rena stayed home to care for Alberta and her siblings. They were a very close-knit family. Alberta was known as a kind and shy child and as she got older became known as a caring person who loved life and viewed the world as a good place, content with whatever came her way. Her siblings sometimes thought she trusted people too much and were always a little extra protective of their sister.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"306\" height=\"423\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/alberta-photo.jpeg?resize=306%2C423&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3512\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/alberta-photo.jpeg?w=306&amp;ssl=1 306w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/alberta-photo.jpeg?resize=188%2C260&amp;ssl=1 188w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 306px) 100vw, 306px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Alberta Williams (Justice for Native Women)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Each spring the Willams family would visit the coast where Alberta&#8217;s father worked as a fisherman and her mother worked in the canneries. The family moved from Gitanyow to Prince Rupert. Soon after, Alberta&#8217;s sister Claudia moved to Vancouver, and Alberta&#8217;s parents sent each of their children to stay with Claudia to attend high school there. Her parents wanted their children to get a good education and see more than what a small town could offer. Both sisters finished high school, began working and soon started sharing an apartment in downtown Vancouver.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Vancouver, it is not uncommon for residents to leave the city and head north for seasonal jobs. Alberta and her sister Claudia usually headed up to Prince Rupert for positions at B.C. Packers plant, a popular salmon cannery. The work was hard, but after a couple of month&#8217;s work, the two sisters would head back to Vancouver well paid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1989, Alberta was 24 years old and living in Vancouver with her fianc\u00e9. It was nearing the end of the summer and she was getting ready to head back home from the summer&#8217;s seasonal work in Prince Rupert. She was looking forward to starting a new job as a waitress and had plans to enroll in college. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Friday, August 25th, marked the last day of work for Alberta and her sister Claudia at the cannery. The two planned to head to Bogey&#8217;s Cabaret, also known as Popeye&#8217;s (the two bars were often interchangeable to locals as one was located upstairs, and the other downstairs). The bar was a well-known establishment located in Prince Rupert Hotel, where people would go to let loose after a week of work. The sisters planned to celebrate and meet up with a group of friends that night. The bar was located along Second Avenue West, which was located on the route Highway 16 takes through downtown Prince Rupert.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/pr-hotel.jpg?resize=611%2C344&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3482\" width=\"611\" height=\"344\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/pr-hotel.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/pr-hotel.jpg?resize=462%2C260&amp;ssl=1 462w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/pr-hotel.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 611px) 100vw, 611px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Bogey&#8217;s Cabaret, located at Prince Rupert Hotel in the 1980s (CBC.ca)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Late that night, Alberta&#8217;s brother Francis Williams remembered getting a call from his sister on a payphone outside of the bar. Alberta was trying to convince him to come to the bar to party with them. Alberta was not known to be much of a partier and was someone who rarely drank, but she was excited to spend her last night in town celebrating with her friends and family in Prince Rupert. He remembered her sounding happy and carefree. Despite Alberta&#8217;s request, Francis decided to stay home as he had a very early fishing trip planned with his father the next day, which he knew he could not miss.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Claudia did join Alberta that night. When she arrived at Bogey&#8217;s, she remembered seeing her sister laughing and having a good time with a large group of friends. The bar was crowded and by the time Claudia arrived there was nowhere to sit near Alberta. The bar was so packed they had joined a bunch of small tables together to form a large long one. Claudia greeted her sister then made her way through the bar watching the band, chatting with friends, and occasionally checking in on her sister. She remembers the mood as a good one, everyone laughing, dancing, and chatting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At closing time, the more than 100 bar patrons spilled out onto the streets. Claudia found Alberta outside laughing with friends. She remembered her sister trying to convince her to come along with her to a house party. During their discussion, Claudia&#8217;s ex-boyfriend approached her wanting to talk. Claudia told her sister to wait a moment while she addressed her ex, mainly to tell him she had no plans on speaking to him that night. When she turned back around to Alberta, she, and the group of people she had been with, were gone. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Claudia waited around 30 minutes for her sister to reappear outside, she went through the hotel lobby and bathroom and looked down the adjoining streets but saw no sign of her sister. She eventually headed home comforted by the fact that Alberta was with family and friends and would be safe with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next morning, Alberta&#8217;s mother Rena awoke to find Alberta&#8217;s bed still made, she phoned Claudia to ask if Alberta was with her but Claudia reassured her that Alberta probably had a long night and had stayed over at a friend&#8217;s house. That afternoon, Alberta still hadn&#8217;t appeared. By dusk, her brother and father received a call from Rena letting them know that Alberta had not been home. Rena had called around to Alberta&#8217;s friends but no one had seen her. The father and son assured her Alberta would turn up, as they were docking for the night and would head back to Prince Rupert the next day. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the time Francis and Lawrence had arrived back from their trip on Sunday, Alberta was still nowhere to be found. Lawrence and Rena went to their local police station to file a missing person report. Family and police knew something was wrong because Alberta was not the type of person to leave without telling anyone, she was not a known partier, had never run away, and most importantly\u2014 she had a return ticket back to Vancouver which she failed to show up for. Family and friends did extensive searches throughout Prince Rupert and police began investigating and interviewing those at the bar that night.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Three weeks after Alberta disappeared, on September 25th, 1989, Alberta&#8217;s body was discovered east of Prince Rupert on Highway 16. Hikers were in the area that day crossing the railroad track to a trail when they discovered the body of a woman lying face down in a ditch covered in shrubs and debris. The body belonged to Alberta. The case soon went from a missing person to homicide as there were obvious signs of a violent struggle, her body was found with only a blouse and a bra on, and it was clear she was very likely a victim of sexual assault.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>I mean there is no doubt in my mind that Alberta did whatever she could to get away from whoever it was. She died a horrible death. I mean it is \u2014like, there&#8217;s no way to minimize it. It&#8217;s&#8230;horrible. </p>\n<cite>Garry Kerr, retired RCMP officer and lead investigator in Alberta&#8217;s case in 1989 (CBC: Who Killed Alberta Williams?)</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Garry Kerr, who worked at the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) at the time, was the lead investigator for the case but would be transferred to another unit after only one year on the case. He has stated openly since his retirement that he still thinks about this case because it has still never been solved, and believes it can be solved. He believes he knows who killed Alberta but police were unable to get a search warrant or to arrest him at the time due to a lack of evidence. Claudia also believes this man, Alberta&#8217;s uncle, is responsible for her death. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Claudia remembered that the night Alberta disappeared she said she was going to a party at his house. The man&#8217;s wife and son were out of town that weekend and had gone to Gitanyow. He was the last known person to be seen with Alberta. A house guest that night also remembered being woken up from sleep and seeing multiple people at the house, including Alberta. A friend of Alberta&#8217;s, Geraldine Morrisson, also remembered her uncle acting odd on the night of her disappearance at Bogey&#8217;s,  like he wasn&#8217;t a family member but more of an overprotective boyfriend to Alberta. Garry also became suspicious of him when police were conducting interviews with family and friends and he was evasive and then became uncooperative after Alberta&#8217;s body was found. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/alberta-williamss-newspaper.jpeg?resize=547%2C308&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3492\" width=\"547\" height=\"308\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/alberta-williamss-newspaper.jpeg?w=616&amp;ssl=1 616w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/alberta-williamss-newspaper.jpeg?resize=462%2C260&amp;ssl=1 462w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 547px) 100vw, 547px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Newspaper clipping of Alberta Williams (CBC.ca)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Some of Alberta&#8217;s relatives also remembered seeing Alberta the weekend of her disappearance. Alberta&#8217;s cousin Amanda remembered seeing Alberta in a black pickup truck after the night of her disappearance with her uncle and the boyfriend of Alberta&#8217;s youngest sister, Kathy. The trio was seen in Terrace, a town approximately an hour and a half from Prince Rupert. They had stopped by Amanda&#8217;s house to use the bathroom and borrow $20 for gas money for the trip back to Prince Rupert. Amanda remembered that Alberta seemed heavily intoxicated when they stopped at the house because she had to help her out of the truck to use the bathroom. Alberta was seen getting in the truck, and then the truck drove away and Alberta was never seen or heard from again. Despite these sightings, this information was never given officially to the police. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Relationships between the Indigenous community and RCMP were and remain strained as issues of racism, neglect, brutality, and apathy towards the community have always been present. The Indigenous community also faces a painful past with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Indian_residential_school_system\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">residential schooling</a> and the RCMP&#8217;s involvement in that. Oftentimes people feared going to the RCMP and did not view them as an establishment to be trusted, which is why many people remain silent or were never interviewed in the first place. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>A lot of it had to do, I think with the mistrust of police, and [the feeling that] &#8216;we&#8217;re native so they&#8217;re not going to do anything.</p>\n<cite>Garry Kerr, retired RCMP officer and lead investigator in Alberta&#8217;s case in 1989 (Highway of Tears)</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This case is still unsolved and there have been no arrests or suspects, although the case is still being actively investigated. Alberta&#8217;s family took her home to Gitanyow and buried her next to her sister, Pamela.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since Alberta&#8217;s disappearance, a RCMP Task Force called E-PANA was created to investigate the series of unsolved murders along this highway, including Alberta. The purpose of the task force was \u201cto determine if a serial killer, or killers, is responsible for murdering young women traveling along major highways in BC\u201d (<a href=\"https://bc-cb.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/ViewPage.action?siteNodeId=23&amp;languageId=1&amp;contentId=27048\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">E-PANA website</a>). To date, however, this case still remains unsolved, as do all the cases along the highway included in E-PANA. Alberta&#8217;s family is still searching for answers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://thehueandcry.com/highway-of-tears\">View more cases from the Highway of Tears</a>.</p>\n",

		"content": {
			"rendered": "\n<p>Alishia Germaine was born as a member of the First Nations in Prince George, British Columbia. Growing up Alishia was known to be an affectionate girl who loved to sing and act. Alishia had what was described as a &#8220;tumultuous&#8221; home life and she began to act out, especially after her parents separated. At age twelve Alishia fled her family home. Her mother remembered her as a sensitive girl who, although put on a hard exterior as she grew older, was still very soft deep down inside. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/alishia-photo2.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3188\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Alishia Germaine (Justice for Native Women)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>A Prince George youth worker recalled Alishia as &#8220;tough, independent and someone who didn&#8217;t fit in well at group homes or with foster families.&#8221; As a result, Alishia eventually ended up on the streets. Alishia&#8217;s mother unsuccessfully tried to get her off the streets but didn&#8217;t know how. Living on the street, Alishia eventually became addicted to drugs and was sexually exploited. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>She got a little taste of freedom and she got in with the wrong crowd. I didn&#8217;t know what the solution was, to get her off the streets. I tried but I didn&#8217;t know how to help her.</p>\n<cite>Debra Germaine, mother of Alishia Germaine (Highway of Tears)</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Near the end of 1994, Alishia was trying hard to turn her life around. She was trying to quit drugs and wanted to return to high school to finish Grade 10. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Friday, December 9, the Prince George Native Friendship Centre was throwing their annual Christmas party for street kids, who for a day were able to eat a turkey dinner, dance, and receive donated gifts. Around 150 kids showed up to the party and that night a youth worker remembered after dinner Alishia said that she was going to leave briefly with her cousin and that she would return and wanted to know if they could save her a present. Alisha never returned to the party and was never seen or heard from again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At 11 o&#8217;clock that night, three teenagers were walking behind Haldi Road Elementary School, which was located on the outskirts of Prince George in a forested area off of Highway 16. There they discovered Alishia&#8217;s body. She had been stabbed to death.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last known sighting of Alishia alive was on a sidewalk downtown. Alishia was 15 years old and was murdered less than six months after her friend, <a href=\"https://thehueandcry.com/roxanne-thiara/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Roxanne Thiara</a>, another Prince George teen, went missing. Shortly after Alishia&#8217;s death, police released a sketch of a potential suspect, but no substantial leads were ever received from it. Police believe they have a suspect, but unfortunately, no arrests have been made as there was not enough evidence to charge the suspect. They are also looking for a female whose DNA was found at the crime scene but have not been able to make any matches so far.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>She had potential. We all make mistakes, but it didn&#8217;t mean that mistake would be carried into her adult years.</p>\n<cite>Connie Menton, aunt of Alishia Germaine (Highway of Tears)</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Since Alishia&#8217;s disappearance, a Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Task Force called E-PANA was created to investigate the series of unsolved murders along this highway, including Alishia&#8217;s. The purpose of the task force was \u201cto determine if a serial killer, or killers, is responsible for murdering young women traveling along major highways in BC\u201d (<a href=\"https://bc-cb.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/ViewPage.action?siteNodeId=23&amp;languageId=1&amp;contentId=27048\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">E-PANA website</a>). To date, however, this case still remains unsolved, as do all the cases along the highway included in E-PANA. Alishia&#8217;s family is still searching for answers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://thehueandcry.com/highway-of-tears\">View more cases from the Highway of Tears</a>.</p>\n",

		"content": {
			"rendered": "\n<p>Tamara Chipman was born in Prince Rupert, British Colombia as a member of the Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en Nation. Tamara was known as a lively and mischievous child who had inherited her mother&#8217;s thick and curly hair. Growing up she spent a lot of time with her grandfather Jack, who was a heavy-duty mechanic, and often accompanied him as he repaired big machines. His death hit Tamara hard and the family soon moved to Terrace, where Tamara spent the majority of her teenage years. Tamara was known as a feisty and fiery teenager, unafraid to back down from any person or situation.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"261\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/tamar-chipman-image.jpeg?resize=261%2C320&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3067\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/tamar-chipman-image.jpeg?w=261&amp;ssl=1 261w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/tamar-chipman-image.jpeg?resize=212%2C260&amp;ssl=1 212w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 261px) 100vw, 261px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Tamara Chipman (Justice for Native Women)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>She was the humour, the laughter, behind all of us when we were all at home for family gatherings.</p>\n<cite>Gladys Radek, aunt of Tamara Chipman (CBC.ca)</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Tamara had a close relationship with her aunt Gladys Radek, who had also moved back to Terrace when Tamara was around 18 years old. The two would see each other almost daily, chatting over a big pot of coffee. Tamara would talk about her dreams of getting married and starting a family. Gladys had moved back to Terrace to bring charges against a man who had abused her during her time in foster care there. Tamara was a great support to her during this difficult time. The man who had abused Gladys as a child was soon convicted and Gladys returned to her home in Vancouver following the decision. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tamara gave birth her to son Jaden at the age of nineteen. Being a young single mother was difficult for Tamara and her family noticed it took a toll on her in the years following  Jaden&#8217;s birth. Her mother remembered worrying that she was hanging out with a &#8220;not very nice&#8221; crowd of people and that she felt Tamara did not seem like herself and might be getting into drugs.  </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>She was just going through a really hard time at that point.</p>\n<cite>Corry Millwater, mother of Tamara Chipman (Highway of Tears)</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Her parents had separated years earlier and her mother Cory Millwater moved back to Prince Rupert, while her father Tom Chipman remained in Terrace. Tamara split her time between both places, visiting each parent frequently. In September of 2005, Tamara had already been in Prince Rupert for a couple of days, but this time without her car, as it had broken down weeks earlier and was waiting to get repaired in Terrace. Her father&#8217;s good friend remembered seeing Tamara hitchhiking east towards Terrace at Industrial Park just outside of Prince Rupert on the afternoon of September 21, but never saw her again after that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It would be months before Tamara would be reported as missing. Her father worked as a fisherman and during the fishing season, he would be gone for long periods of time. It was not uncommon for there to be stretches of time without communication between him and his daughter. Her family in Prince Rupert assumed she was spending time in Terrace, while her family in Terrace assumed she was spending time in Prince Rupert. Tamara was also facing assault charges at the time and when she missed her court date some assumed she was trying to avoid sentencing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In early November, Tom realized no one had heard from Tamara for some time, her rent hadn&#8217;t been paid, and her bank account had been untouched for months. He reported her missing to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). On November 15, a joint investigation between Prince Rupert and Terrace was officially started to search for Tamara. Tom found the police helpful during this time and considered himself lucky compared to other families whose daughters had gone missing under similar circumstances. The police put out a call to the public for any information regarding Tamara&#8217;s disappearance and newspapers also picked up the story.  Several searches by volunteers were conducted over a span of over two months and Tom walked the highway connecting Prince Rupert and Terrace himself, searching the area for any trace of Tamara. The family even headed to Vancouver after receiving a claimed sighting of her and walked the streets and handed out flyers but to no avail. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although there were no named suspects\u2014the RCMP are fairly certain they know what happened to Tamara. Since her death, two men and one woman have come forward stating that they saw Tamara hitchhiking and picked her up. The woman told police that as they were driving towards Terrace, one of the men began arguing with Tamara and then hit her and strangled her to death in the car. They then pulled over in a remote area along the highway where they dumped her body. The man who killed her soon returned to the area to move and bury her body in the forest, where it would be concealed better. After hearing this, the police searched the area with the female witness and cadaver dogs but Tamara&#8217;s body was never found. The witness and two men are now dead, which makes it difficult to move forward with this allegation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since Tamara&#8217;s disappearance, an RCMP Task Force called E-PANA was created to investigate the series of unsolved murders along this highway, including Tamara&#8217;s. The purpose of the task force was \u201cto determine if a serial killer, or killers, is responsible for murdering young women traveling along major highways in BC\u201d (<a href=\"https://bc-cb.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/ViewPage.action?siteNodeId=23&amp;languageId=1&amp;contentId=27048\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">E-PANA website</a>). To date, however, this case still remains unsolved, as do all the cases along the highway included in E-PANA. Tamara left behind a 2-year-old son and her family is still searching for answers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://thehueandcry.com/highway-of-tears\">View more cases from the Highway of Tears</a>.</p>\n",

Mildred was eventually granted legal guardianship of Roxanne when she was a child. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;She was quite a good kid \u2013 a really happy, bubbly kid,&#8221; recalled Mildred. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"225\" height=\"330\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/roxanne-thiara-bw.jpg?resize=225%2C330&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3009\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/roxanne-thiara-bw.jpg?w=225&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/roxanne-thiara-bw.jpg?resize=177%2C260&amp;ssl=1 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Roxanne Thiara (The Vancouver Sun)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>As an adolescent, Roxanne began struggling to attend school regularly and started to hang out with a crowd that was considered a &#8220;bad bunch,&#8221; according to Mildred. At the age of twelve, Roxanne was incarcerated in a youth detention center for an unknown petty offense. In the detention center, Roxanne befriended another girl, Kristal Grenkie. Kristal remembered Roxanne as just a young and innocent child in the detention center. Roxanne&#8217;s former brother-in-law, Rene Beirness said the incarceration was, &#8220;the worst thing that happened to her&#8221; and that after her release &#8220;she went wild.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After her release, Roxanne spent the majority of her time in Williams Lake, a town just outside of Quesnel. Finding it difficult to reintegrate she turned to drugs and engaged in survival sex, a form of sex trafficking in order to survive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite all these difficulties, Mildred still remembered Roxanne dropping by her house or calling every couple of days. Her family kept faith that things would turn around for her, and in late June of 1994 Roxanne even told Mildred that she wanted to enter rehab to stop her addiction. She had always wanted to be a fashion designer and wanted to pursue a better life. She made an appointment to enter a drug treatment program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On June 27, 1994, Roxanne left Mildred&#8217;s house in Quesnel to return to Prince George to collect her belongings. She told Mildred that she would return the next day. That was the last Mildred ever heard from or saw Roxanne as she did not return to Quesnel as promised. Shortly thereafter, during a long weekend in July, Roxanne told a friend that she was going out with a customer in downtown Prince George. She walked around the corner of a building and was never seen again. Throughout the month of July Mildred began searching and calling around to see if anyone had seen or heard from Roxanne, flyers were handed out and she was officially reported missing, but there was no news of Roxanne.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On August 17, 1994, approximately one month after she disappeared, Roxanne&#8217;s body was found dumped in the bush along Highway 16, just before the town of Burns Lake. She had been murdered and was 15 years old. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>When she did want to change, she wasn&#8217;t given the chance.</p>\n<cite>Mildred Thiara, legal guardian of Roxanne Thiara (Highway of Tears)</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>After her body was found, police released Roxanne&#8217;s photo to the public in hopes that someone would come forward with information and they received close to forty tips after releasing her photo. They believed that whoever murdered Roxanne did so elsewhere and then dumped her body by Highway 16. They believe the killer knew the area around the Highway well. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>We&#8217;re still having a hard time coming to terms with everything. She was a well-loved little girl; she was well-adored.</p>\n<cite>Mildred Thiara, legal guardian of Roxanne Thiara (Highway of Tears)</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The family had a small funeral to honor Roxanne&#8217;s life and the tips unfortunately did not lead the police to her killer. Since Roxanne&#8217;s disappearance, a Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Task Force called E-PANA was created to investigate the series of unsolved murders along this highway, including Roxanne&#8217;s. The purpose of the task force was \u201cto determine if a serial killer, or killers, is responsible for murdering young women traveling along major highways in BC\u201d (<a href=\"https://bc-cb.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/ViewPage.action?siteNodeId=23&amp;languageId=1&amp;contentId=27048\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">E-PANA website</a>). To date, however, this case still remains unsolved, as do all the cases along the highway included in E-PANA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://thehueandcry.com/highway-of-tears\">View more cases from the Highway of Tears</a>.</p>\n",

			"rendered": "\n<p>Private First Class Vanessa Guillen was 20 years old and from Houston, Texas. Family and friends know her as someone who loves to be active &#8211; working out, going on a run, or playing soccer with friends. After graduating from high school she enlisted in the army when she was 18 years old. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vanessa was first stationed in South Carolina and then Virginia before landing in the Fort Hood Military base in Texas at the beginning of 2020. She was stationed there working as a 91F, Small Arms/Artillery Repairer.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"400\" height=\"386\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/vanessa-guillen.jpg?resize=400%2C386&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2322\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/vanessa-guillen.jpg?w=400&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/vanessa-guillen.jpg?resize=269%2C260&amp;ssl=1 269w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Vanessa Guillen (NBC News)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>She was close to her family and would often come home during the weekends to spend time with them. Her sister, Mayra Guillen, recalls a change in Vanessa when she arrived at Fort Hood, however. She remembered her not being as joyful and once getting a text message from Vanessa saying that she didn&#8217;t like being at Fort Hood, and would one day open up to her as to why.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the morning of Wednesday, April 22, Vanessa texted her boyfriend Juan Cruz to tell him that she was headed to work in the armory room on base. Nothing seemed amiss and Vanessa seemed happy to him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Around noon, Juan texted Vanessa but none of his messages were being read. Maya then called Vanessa and her call went straight to voicemail and when she sent her a text, it couldn&#8217;t be delivered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vanessa was last seen at 1 pm in the parking lot of her Regimental Engineer Squadron Headquarters, 3rd Cavalry Regiment, on Fort Hood. She was seen wearing black Nike shoes, a black t-shirt, and purple fitness-type pants. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Investigators later found her car keys, barracks room key, ID, and wallet, in the armory room where she was working earlier in the day. Her cellphone could not be found and was last tracked in Belton, Texas which is approximately 20 minutes from where she was last seen. Her family, boyfriend, and friends have not heard from her since she disappeared.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>She was a very responsible person. I know she just wouldn&#8217;t leave her stuff there. I know my sister, she wouldn&#8217;t leave stuff there if she didn&#8217;t know she wasn&#8217;t coming back.</p>\n<cite>Mayra Guillen, sister of Vanessa Guillen (KWTX) </cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Shortly after Vanessa was reported missing, Fort Hood Military Police issued a &#8220;Be on the Lookout&#8221; (BOLO) alert to nearby law enforcement. According to a press release, a spokesman for Fort Hood said that their search efforts initially included more than 500 soldiers from the base searching on foot and that they are now conducting targeted searches in smaller groups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gloria Guillen, the mother of Vanessa, gave an <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAAH5YpIUVg&amp;ab_channel=RaulBrindis\" target=\"_blank\">in-depth interview</a> with Raul Brindis about her daughter&#8217;s disappearance (the video is in Spanish, see <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://mamaslatinas.com/parenting-pregnancy/us-soldier-vanessa-guillen-after-sexual-harassment-claims-at-texas-military\" target=\"_blank\">Mam\u00e1sLatinas article</a> for an English summary). She stated the following: her daughter told her she was being sexually harassed on base by a sergeant who would follow her whenever she would run or exercise, making her feel very uncomfortable. When Gloria told her daughter to report the sergeant, Vanessa replied by telling her other women have reported the same officer, only to have no one believe them. She was also fearful of retaliation if she did report him. After her daughter&#8217;s disappearance, Gloria received a phone call from a sergeant on base who elected to remain anonymous in fear of violent retaliation. He told her that he believed Vanessa was kidnapped inside the base and alluded to issues of corruption and secrecy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vanessa was unfortunately never able to give her mother the name of the sergeant who was harassing her before she went missing. </p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>UPDATE &#8211; July 6, 2020</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>More than two months after Vanessa Guillen was last seen, partial human remains were found in a shallow grave by the Leon River by contractors working on a fence near the river. The buried remains appeared to have been encased in a concrete-like substance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The family&#8217;s lawyer, Natalie Khawam stated that the CID told her Vanessa was bludgeoned to death with a hammer in the armory room and then later transported off the base in a box, dismembered, and buried in the woods.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main suspect in Vanessa&#8217;s killing is 20-year-old, Spc. Aaron David Robinson of Calumet City. After being confronted by Army investigators, he shot and killed himself. His estranged wife, Cecily Aguilar is currently in police custody for assisting with the dismemberment and disposal of Vanessa&#8217;s body. </p>\n",

Lana was known to family and friends as a bit of a prankster who loved the outdoors. She was determined to go to college after high school and in 1995, she enrolled in the forestry program at Northwest Community College in Houston, British Colombia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Northwest Community College had many campuses in varying communities along the northwest stretch of Highway 16. Lana was attending classes in Houston which was a three-hour drive from Terrace. In college, Lana was known as a good student who took her studies seriously and a person who made friends quickly. She still visited her family often, going back home on weekends to visit them.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"404\" height=\"463\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/lana-derrick-photo.png?resize=404%2C463&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2169\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/lana-derrick-photo.png?w=404&amp;ssl=1 404w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/lana-derrick-photo.png?resize=227%2C260&amp;ssl=1 227w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 404px) 100vw, 404px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Lana Derrick (Unidentified Wiki)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The Friday before Thanksgiving, Lana got a ride back to Terrace with a fellow classmate. She knew her parents Marge and Darvin Haugan were preparing to work all weekend in order to finish a forestry contract so when she arrived at their house, she dropped off her belongings and headed into town.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> Lana&#8217;s stepsister Clarice Dessert was driving around town when she spotted Lana walking on the street and stopped to let her know that her father had given her cash for Lana to pick up. Lana asked if Clarice could pick up the money and take it to her apartment as Clarice lived downtown and it was easier for Lana to get it there. The girls then parted ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clarice&#8217;s younger sister was spending the night with her that night and the two went to bed early. Sometime around 3:00 am Clarice woke up to the sound of someone knocking on her door. Clarice remembered being half asleep and opening the door to find Lana, who had come to collect her money.  She remembered chatting with Lana for a little bit and being invited to a party that she declined to go too. She gave Lana $30 and the two said goodnight. Clarice didn&#8217;t recall seeing a vehicle or headlights or any other person around. Lana seemed intoxicated but didn&#8217;t seem upset or anxious and nothing seemed out of the ordinary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Saturday, Marge and Darvin noticed Lana&#8217;s bag at home, but they figured she had stayed over at a friend&#8217;s house after a night out. Rarely at home that weekend, on Monday they had still not seen their daughter and her belongings still lay untouched. When Lana did not show up on Tuesday,  they knew something was not right as classes started that day and their daughter never missed school.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After contacting friends and family they realized that no one had seen their daughter in three days. They then went to the police to file a missing person report. Marge and Darvin remember feeling brushed off and having police suggest that Lana was probably out partying or staying with a boyfriend for a few days. Despite her family insisting otherwise, no real search occurred for Lana until nearly a week after this initial meeting. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lana&#8217;s family, friends and community came together to search for her all over British Colombia before, during, and after any police help. After a couple of days assisting in the search, police decided it was time to call it off.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>They had put in their seventy-two hours. Everybody go home now, we&#8217;ll let you know what we find out. And we said, you go home. We&#8217;re not done.</p>\n<cite>Marge Haugan, Lana&#8217;s mother (Highway of Tears)</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>A month after the report was filed, a witness came forward to say they had seen Lana at the Petro-Canada gas station in Thornhill at around 3:30 am on the morning of her disappearance. Thornhill is located across the river from downtown Terrace and the gas station sits on the south side of Highway 16. The witness claimed to have seen Lana get out of the backseat of a blue car, walk into the gas station convenience store and then walk out and back into the car, before it drove off, heading north to the Northern Motor Inn. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, police could not recover footage from the gas station as that night&#8217;s security footage had already been recorded over. Sketches and detailed descriptions were also released of the two men thought to have been in the car with Lana, but nothing ever came of it. Lana&#8217;s supposed boyfriend was also a suspect. He was someone Clarice had also dated briefly, but whom she broke things off with after an incident where he became intoxicated and rough with her. Clarice had gotten a call the morning after Lana disappeared saying that he had committed suicide the previous night. Police looked into this but could not find any connection with his death and her disappearance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since Lana&#8217;s disappearance, a Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Task Force called E-PANA was created to investigate the series of unsolved murders along this highway, including Lana&#8217;s. The purpose of the task force was \u201cto determine if a serial killer, or killers, is responsible for murdering young women traveling along major highways in BC\u201d (<a href=\"https://bc-cb.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/ViewPage.action?siteNodeId=23&amp;languageId=1&amp;contentId=27048\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">E-PANA website</a>). To date, however, this case still remains unsolved, as do all the cases along the highway included in E-PANA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://thehueandcry.com/highway-of-tears\">View more cases from the Highway of Tears</a>.</p>\n",

			"rendered": "\n<p>Delphine Nikal is a member of the Wet&#8217;suwet&#8217;en tribe and was the youngest of her family and born on a farm near Smithers, British Columbia. She was born in the same hospital as <a aria-label=\"Ramona Wilson (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://wordpress.thehueandcry.com/highway-of-tears/ramona-wilson/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ramona Wilson</a> and was known as an adventurous child who loved animals. When Delphine was only 11 years old her father died and Delphine moved to the neighboring village of Telkwa to live with her mother.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"350\" height=\"390\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/delphine-nikal-photo.jpg?resize=350%2C390&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2055\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/delphine-nikal-photo.jpg?w=350&amp;ssl=1 350w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/delphine-nikal-photo.jpg?resize=233%2C260&amp;ssl=1 233w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Delphine Nikal (missingkids.ca)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>In 1990, Delphine was 15 years old and her mother Judy fell ill after a surgery had gone wrong and ended up spending four months in a coma in a Prince George hospital. The hospital was a four-hour drive from their village so at this time Delphine went to live with her uncle Frank Tompkins who lived across the street from them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Wednesday, June 13 at approximately 2:00 pm, Delphine told her uncle that she was going into town to meet up with some friends. Delphine met up with her close friend Kristal Grenkie and two other girls. The girls wandered around town during the afternoon and as evening approached, the group headed to Mohawk gas station which was located on the corner of Main Street and Highway 16. Delphi&#8217;s friends remembered her asking them if they wanted to spend the night at her house as her mother was not home. The girls thought it was unusual because she had never asked any of them before to spend the night. The girls were unable to go, however, because of school and work the next day. After the group parted ways, Delphine called her uncle to tell him she was headed home. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Delphine Nikal was last seen hitchhiking in the eastbound lane of Highway 16 but never made it home. In the following days when Delphine&#8217;s family reported her missing, they were met with suggestions that she had probably run off and would return soon. Delphine was known to police, as she had been charged with previous minor offenses such as theft and mischief and had been in and out of youth facilities in the province. With no help from the police, the family was left to search for Delphine on their own, knocking on doors and driving throughout Vancouver looking for her. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>There was no, literally no support. The cops never really showed a whole lot of interest&#8230;They obviously didn&#8217;t really care.</p>\n<cite>Mary Nikal, sister of Delphine (Highway of Tears)</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>When police finally got involved they ruled out foul play, citing the fact that many young people go missing each year and eventually turn up on the streets of Vancouver. This was hard for Delphine&#8217;s family to make sense of as Delphine&#8217;s mother was very sick and she would never have left her. All her belongings were still at home and her friends knew she would have confided in them about her plan and would not have invited them over that night if she was planning on running away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With additional help from Canpro Investigation Services and The Missing Children Society of Canada offering a $10,000 reward, information started to come in about Delphine. An employee at Mohawk gas station claimed to have seen Delphine getting into a red sports car on the night of her disappearance. Her uncle was also looked into, but there was evidence to suggest that Delphine never made it home that night and he eventually passed away. It was also thought that Delphine may have ended up at a party that night in a rural area near Smithers but all of these leads led to dead ends after further investigation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In March of 2019, a witness came forward with information regarding Delphine which confirmed suspicions that Delphine was most likely picked up by someone who was on their way out of town. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since Delphine&#8217;s disappearance, an RCMP Task Force called E-PANA was created to investigate the series of unsolved murders along this highway, including Delphine&#8217;s. The purpose of the task force was \u201cto determine if a serial killer, or killers, is responsible for murdering young women traveling along major highways in BC\u201d (<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://bc-cb.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/ViewPage.action?siteNodeId=23&amp;languageId=1&amp;contentId=27048\" target=\"_blank\">E-PANA website</a>). To date, however, this case still remains unsolved, as do all the cases along the highway included in E-PANA. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://thehueandcry.com/highway-of-tears\">View more cases from the Highway of Tears</a>.</p>\n",

Aielah was the youngest of six children and was part of the Leidli T&#8217;enneh First Nations. Aielah, her siblings, and her mother were a close unit, despite moving around a lot and even being separated for periods of time.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"439\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/aielah-auger-photo.jpg?resize=439%2C600&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1981\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/aielah-auger-photo.jpg?w=439&amp;ssl=1 439w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/aielah-auger-photo.jpg?resize=190%2C260&amp;ssl=1 190w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 439px) 100vw, 439px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Aielah Saric-Auger (RCMP)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>On Thursday, February 2\u2014Aielah, her sister Kyla and her brother Tim headed to the Pine Centre Mall to spend the day shopping and hanging out. Pine Centre Mall was located four kilometers from their house and was the largest of its kind in Prince George at that time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aielah and her sister ran into some friends at the mall and the group decided to go out drinking that night. Despite Aielah&#8217;s attempts to persuade her brother to come, Tim decided to skip the outing and head home, leaving his sisters in the mall parking lot as they headed off with their friends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No one knows for sure what happened that night because at some point, Aielah and her sister were separated and went different ways. Kyla arrived home early in the morning but didn&#8217;t find her sister at home as she was expecting. The family spent the entire day waiting for Aielah to come home and tried to retrace the steps of the previous night in hopes of finding her but were unsuccessful. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Friday morning, Audrey Auger, Aielah&#8217;s mother went to the police to report her daughter missing. The police told her to wait 78 hours to see if Aielah would show up, and if she didn&#8217;t \u2014then she could come back again and file a report.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The family officially filed a report four days later on February 6. During this time, the family searched the city, contacted friends and family, and put up posters all over town.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On February 10, almost a week after she was last seen at the mall, a motorist driving on the outskirts of Prince George alerted police to seeing something in a ditch alongside Highway 16, near Tabor Mountain. When police went to investigate, they discovered the body of a young woman in the ditch. The body was identified as that of Aielah Auger. Her body was found approximately twenty-three kilometers east of downtown Prince George. Aielah&#8217;s body was found without any of her clothes or belongings. Police only recovered a necklace around her neck that Audrey later identified as one that she had given to her.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Police determined that Aielah had died from blunt force trauma to the head. While investigating her death police suggested that Aielah had gone to a friend&#8217;s house late that night to get a ride home. That friend&#8217;s mother was unable to drive her home though and Aeilah, not wanting to call her mother for a ride, was seen walking towards a house where drug users were known to hang out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Police investigated dozens of people known to hang out at that house but everyone was cleared. They also collected surveillance video from surrounding areas and from the video they discovered two sightings of Aeilah at gas stations heading in the direction of her house. The video showed Aielah walking north on the 2100 block of Quince Street and passing the Save-On-Foods gas bar around 1 a.m. Audrey also had information including Aielah going to her friend&#8217;s for a sleepover the night she went to the mall and her being last seen getting into a black van. None of these leads or clues have lead to any arrests or suspects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since Aielah&#8217;s death, a Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Task Force called E-PANA was created to investigate the series of unsolved murders along this highway, including Aielah&#8217;s. The purpose of the task force was \u201cto determine if a serial killer, or killers, is responsible for murdering young women traveling along major highways in BC\u201d (<a href=\"https://bc-cb.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/ViewPage.action?siteNodeId=23&amp;languageId=1&amp;contentId=27048\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">E-PANA website</a>). To date, however, this case still remains unsolved, as do all the cases along the highway included in E-PANA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the years after Aielah&#8217;s death, Audrey never gave up on her search for answers and set out each year to walk what she called &#8220;The Highway of Hope&#8221; to create awareness of Aielah&#8217;s murder and for the other women who have gone missing or been murdered along Highway 16.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/gp201310304129965ar-jpg.jpg?resize=640%2C450&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2246\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/gp201310304129965ar-jpg.jpg?w=804&amp;ssl=1 804w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/gp201310304129965ar-jpg.jpg?resize=370%2C260&amp;ssl=1 370w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/gp201310304129965ar-jpg.jpg?resize=768%2C540&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Audrey Auger, mother of Aielah (Prince George Citizen)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Tragically, on March 5, 2013, Audrey was the victim of a vehicle collision on Highway 16 where she died.

			"rendered": "\n<p>In 1994, Ramona Lisa Wilson was 16 years old and living with her family in Smithers, British Columbia. Ramona was part of the Gitxsan nations and the youngest of six children in her family. She had a bubbly personality was known as a jokester and was well-liked by people. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ramona played outfield on the local baseball team sponsored by the Native Friendship Center and also worked as a dishwasher at Smitty&#8217;s, a popular chain restaurant. Her mother, Matilda Wilson remembered Ramona telling her at the age of 12 that she wanted to be a psychologist and be the first in her family to attend university.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"445\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/ramona-wilson-photo.jpg?resize=640%2C445&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1817\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/ramona-wilson-photo.jpg?w=950&amp;ssl=1 950w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/ramona-wilson-photo.jpg?resize=374%2C260&amp;ssl=1 374w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/ramona-wilson-photo.jpg?resize=768%2C534&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Ramona Lisa Wilson (Hazlitt)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The weekend of June 11 was known as a big weekend for teenagers in Smithers as it marked the weekend of their big graduation party. Teenagers were known to stay out all night with friends and other students for a night of celebration and partying.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matilda remembered Ramona being in a good mood on Saturday night, singing and dancing around the house while getting ready for her night out with friends. She remembered Ramona leaving the house around 9:45 pm, presumably to meet her best friend Kristal Grenkie. Ramona was seen talking to some neighbors before heading on her way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kristal was attending her brother&#8217;s graduation that night and was planning on meeting Ramona afterward at a dance in Hazelton, a town 70 kilometers from them. However, Ramona never showed up to the dance that night and Kristal suspected Ramona&#8217;s plans had changed and she had gone to meet her boyfriend in the village of Moricetown, where he lived. Moricetown is located halfway between Smithers and Hazelton.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Sunday morning, Ramona&#8217;s boyfriend called her house looking for her. Matilda told him that she was with Kristal. After calling Kristal and realizing Ramona was not there, Kristal called Smitty&#8217;s to see if Ramona was in, but she was not scheduled to work until the next day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Monday, Ramona did not appear at school or for her shift at Smitty&#8217;s. Matilda went to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) that day to report her daughter missing but was met with indifference as the officers told her to &#8220;give it some time&#8221; and that her daughter was probably unhappy at home, had runoff, and would reappear. Ramona&#8217;s family didn&#8217;t wait and started their own search for her, calling friends and family and driving around town.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the following week, Ramona&#8217;s bank account, possessions at home, and latest paycheck, all went untouched. Around this time, the RCMP started to actively search for her. The family also had support from the organization, Missing Children&#8217;s Society of Canada, which assisted with searches and contributing to reward money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On April 9, 1995, two teenagers were four-wheeling in an area off Yelich Road just north of the highway, behind the Smithers&#8217; airport, nearby a group of old rugby fields which was known as a popular partying place for teens, when one of their ATVs became stuck in the mud. The boys headed into a nearby wooded area to search for something to use to pry their ATV free. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The boys discovered Ramona Wilson&#8217;s body in the area, almost 11 months after her disappearance. Beside her body was yellow rope and nylon cables. Her clothing\u2014leggings and a purple sweatshirt were found nearby but her shoes were never found.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The RCMP said they followed up on all leads that came in, including rumors of her attending a party at the rugby fields, a run-in with a group of local men in a truck, and visits to unknown apartment complexes on the night of her death, but no arrests were ever made. Since Ramona&#8217;s death, an RCMP Task Force called E-PANA was created to investigate the series of unsolved murders along this highway, including Ramona&#8217;s. The purpose of the task force was &#8220;to determine if a serial killer, or killers, is responsible for murdering young women traveling along major highways in BC&#8221; (<a href=\"https://bc-cb.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/ViewPage.action?siteNodeId=23&amp;languageId=1&amp;contentId=27048\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">E-PANA website</a>). To date, however, this case still remains unsolved, as do all the cases along the highway included in E-PANA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ramona&#8217;s sister Brenda organizes a memorial walk for Ramona each June, where she and others walk along the highway for Ramona and all the missing women and girls who have disappeared along this highway.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/brenda-wilson.jpg?resize=640%2C427&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2254\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/brenda-wilson.jpg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/brenda-wilson.jpg?resize=390%2C260&amp;ssl=1 390w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/brenda-wilson.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Brenda Wilson, sister of Ramona Wilson (BC Local News)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://thehueandcry.com/highway-of-tears\">View more cases from the Highway of Tears</a>.</p>\n",

Sandra was known to be a devoted grandmother, who loved spending time with her family\u2014especially her grandchildren. She spent her days watching the three young boys while Laina worked as a nurse in Boston. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/sandra-crispo.jpg?resize=317%2C595&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1729\" width=\"317\" height=\"595\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/sandra-crispo.jpg?w=446&amp;ssl=1 446w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/sandra-crispo.jpg?resize=138%2C260&amp;ssl=1 138w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 317px) 100vw, 317px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Sandra Crispo (sandracrispo.com)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>On Wednesday, August 7, 2019, Laina drove to her mother&#8217;s house and dropped off her children as usual, before leaving for work. That afternoon, Sandra realized she was having problems with her car and another family member picked her and the boys up to drop the car off at a mechanic. The family member then took her to buy cigarettes at Cumberland Farms, which security cameras confirm. Sandra is then dropped off at her house around 5 p.m.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next day, Laina was at the beach with her sons enjoying her day off, when she received a call from her mother&#8217;s mechanic with a request for parts that would be needed for the repair. Laina called her mother to pass on the information but was unable to reach her that morning. She tried throughout the day as well but her mother never picked up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Friday morning, Laina drove to her mother&#8217;s house to drop off her children for a planned sleepover, but soon realized her mother was nowhere to be found. The lights and air conditioner were still on in the house and the back door was unlocked. Sandra&#8217;s black lab Clarence was also noticeably timid and was out of food and water. Sandra&#8217;s shoes and purse were gone and there was cut-up watermelon in the fridge ready to be eaten that night with her grandchildren.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Knowing she was not the type of person to leave without telling anyone, a missing person report was filed. Police searched her home, surrounding areas and asked the public for help, but are met with dead ends. This case is also particularly difficult because of the lack of a digital trail, as Sandra did not own a cell phone or a computer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sandra&#8217;s family and police are still actively searching for her. </p>\n",

			"rendered": "\n<p>Jennifer Kesse was 24 years old and living in Orlando Florida. She worked as a financial analyst for Central Florida Investments Timeshare Company and had recently purchased a condo. On January 23, 2006,  Jennifer left work at 6 pm and called her father on her way home at 6:15 pm. She also called her boyfriend, Rob Allen at 10:00 pm later that night when she was home. Neither of them noticed anything amiss during their conversations.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"412\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/jennifer-kesse-image.jpg?resize=600%2C412&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1623\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/jennifer-kesse-image.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/jennifer-kesse-image.jpg?resize=379%2C260&amp;ssl=1 379w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Jennifer Kesse (WTSP)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>On January 24, two things out of the ordinary happened. Jennifer always communicated with her boyfriend Rob, either by telephone or text message before she left for work\u2014but she did not contact him at all that morning.  Rob tried contacting her multiple times that day, but all his calls went straight to voicemail. She also failed to show up for work that morning although she had an important meeting. Her co-workers became concerned because they knew it was very unlike her to miss work without giving them notice and they contacted her parents to let them know of her absence.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>That\u2019s not Jennifer.\u00a0Jennifer has always been reachable. When I got that phone call I knew intuitively something happened to her.\u00a0</p>\n<cite><strong>Joyce Kesse</strong>, Jennifer&#8217;s mother (Dateline NBC)</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Upon receiving the news, Jennifer&#8217;s parents Joyce and Drew Kesse drove three hours from their house to her condo to search for her. At her condo, they saw nothing out of the ordinary of someone getting ready to leave for work in the morning. There were still puddles of water in the shower, a damp towel, work clothes laid out on her bed, and hair and makeup items out in the bathroom. Given this scene, police began to think that Jennifer was abducted either during the time it took her to walk to her car or on her way to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jennifer&#8217;s boyfriend and parents were both ruled out as suspects and her ex-boyfriend was interviewed and ruled out as well. Police found it unlikely that she would have left on her own as she appeared to have a stable life, was in a committed relationship, and had recently returned from a vacation with her boyfriend. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Police started to investigate the many construction workers in the area her apartment complex was located in. The complex was only half-finished at the time Jennifer moved in, and a number of workers lived on site. Joyce also remembered her daughter mentioning how she sometimes felt uncomfortable because the workers would cat-call her. Police investigation does not lead to any new information though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On January 26, a big break came\u2014 after seeing Jennifer&#8217;s story on the news, a resident called the police to inform them of a car sitting in the parking lot of their apartment complex. The car was a black Chevy Malibu, which matched the one that Jennifer owned. The car was located roughly a mile away from Jennifer&#8217;s complex and when police searched the car they did not see any sign of a struggle. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Police also obtained surveillance footage of an unidentified person walking in the parking lot at the same time Jennifer&#8217;s car was left in the lot. The footage proved to be extremely frustrating as the camera was programmed to snap photos every three seconds and each time a frame was captured, the suspect&#8217;s face was obstructed by a gate post. The only thing police can determine for sure is that the suspect was between 5\u20193\u201d and 5\u20195 inches tall.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/jennifer-kesse-suspect.jpg?resize=640%2C427&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1607\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/jennifer-kesse-suspect.jpg?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/jennifer-kesse-suspect.jpg?resize=390%2C260&amp;ssl=1 390w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Surveillance footage of the person of interest (jenniferkesse.com)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Since Jennifer&#8217;s disappearance, there has been no activity on her ATM card, or calls from her cell phone. Police extensively searched the areas of Jennifer&#8217;s known whereabouts but with no success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2018, twelve years after Jennifer&#8217;s disappearance and with no new leads, Joyce and Drew Kesse decided to investigate on their own as well. After a successful fight in court to obtain all the files regarding Jennifer&#8217;s case, they are now using their own private investigator to search for Jennifer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On November 8, 2019\u2014 after a tip from the Kessey family investigator, police spent two days at Lake Fischer in Orange County searching for clues. The lake is located 13 miles from Jennifer&#8217;s condo. The search was prompted by a tip from a woman who remembered seeing something odd at the time of Jennifer&#8217;s disappearance. A man drove a pickup truck to the lake and took out a six to eight-foot piece of what looked like, rolled-up carpet and dumped it in the lake before driving off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Police have not disclosed any other information from this search or if they have found anything significant, Police and Jennifer&#8217;s parents continue to search for her.</p>\n",

		"content": {
			"rendered": "\n<p>In 2016, LaShaya Stine was 16 years old and lived with her family in Aurora, Colorado. LaShaya attended George Washington high school and was known to be a good student and was on the honor roll. LaShaya wanted to study nursing in college and she had recently been selected by the University of Colorado Hospital for an internship.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The evening of July 15 was one of anticipation, as LaShaya was looking forward to a job interview the next day. When her mother Sabrina Jones went to bed that night, it would be the last time she would see her daughter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next morning, the family realized that LaShaya was not in the house when they attempted to wake her up for her interview. Her phone went straight to voicemail and attempts to look for her in the neighborhood were unsuccessful. The family contacted the police, who initially treated the case as one of a runaway and it was almost a week later when the police chief, who had been away on vacation returned and took a closer look.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was during this time, that police also informed the family that they had surveillance video of LaShaya the night she went missing. The video was taken at 2:30 am and LaShaya could be seen walking near East Montview Boulevard and Peoria Street.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"386\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/lashaya-video.jpg?resize=640%2C386&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1502\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/lashaya-video.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/lashaya-video.jpg?resize=431%2C260&amp;ssl=1 431w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/lashaya-video.jpg?resize=768%2C463&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Surveillance video of Lashaya walking the night she went missing (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftb4BglyB-U\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"view entire video (opens in a new tab)\">view entire video</a>).</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Sabrina believes that LaShaya had gone to meet someone, and was planning on returning to the house, as her clothes, wallet, and phone charger were still in her room. Her window had also been left open which would have allowed her to re-enter her room. Since her disappearance, no known contact has been made by LaShaya to family and friends. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>LaShaya&#8217;s ex-boyfriend and friends were all questioned, but no clues or information came up that moved the case forward, and no one was suspected of any foul play. Various tips came in that pointed to LaShaya being a victim of human trafficking, including sightings of her coming in and out of motels in areas known to be popular in trafficking. In these sightings, she was seen with a man who was thought to have been taking her in and out of Colorado and into different states. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One tipster claimed to have seen LaShaya in a motel and accurately described a distinct scar on her chest. A girl who escaped from trafficking also came forward claiming to have been with LaShaya. Unfortunately, police were never successful in finding her in any of the locations mentioned in the sightings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2019, an age-progressed photo of LaShaya was released:</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"500\" height=\"625\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/lashaya-age-progression.jpg?resize=500%2C625&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Lashaya Stine\" class=\"wp-image-1508\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/lashaya-age-progression.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/lashaya-age-progression.jpg?resize=208%2C260&amp;ssl=1 208w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Age progression photo of LaShaya Stine (Aurora Police)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h3><strong>UPDATE &#8211; November 21, 2020</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After receiving tips and leads, Aurora police searched a house on 2200 Lansing Street, which is in the same area LaShaya was seen walking the night she disappeared. Police have said she knew the previous residents. Police have searched the house for roughly three days and have brought in equipment that can break through concrete.

		"content": {
			"rendered": "\n<p>In the summer of 2000, Molly Bish was 16 years old and living in Warren, Massachusetts with her family. Molly was an accomplished athlete, and honors student, she was outgoing and well-liked. Molly had just started a summer job as a lifeguard at Comins Pond which was a local man-made swimming area surrounded by a forest. Her older brother had previously held the same position she was taking over.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"397\" height=\"407\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/molly-bish-prom.jpg?resize=397%2C407&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1371\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/molly-bish-prom.jpg?w=397&amp;ssl=1 397w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/molly-bish-prom.jpg?resize=254%2C260&amp;ssl=1 254w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 397px) 100vw, 397px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Molly Bish at prom (Crime Online)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>On the morning of June 27, Molly had woken up to bad news as she found out a soccer teammate had been hit by a car and was in critical condition. It was the first day of swim lessons at the pond though, so she had to get up and go to work. Molly&#8217;s mother Magi accompanied her for the drive to work, and after stopping to pick up some bottles of water and a two-way radio at the police station, they arrived at Comins Pond at 10:00 am. Molly told her mother she loved her, then left the car to get to her lifeguard post. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first people started to arrive at the pond a short while after Molly&#8217;s arrival. A mother noticed that there was no lifeguard present, although it looked like the station has been set up by one. She noticed the first-aid kit was wide open, a backpack was on the bench, a towel draped on the chair, and sandals laying in the sand by the chair.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With swimming lessons having started, the mother informed Parks Commissioner and Molly&#8217;s boss, Ed Fett, that there was no lifeguard on duty. At 11:44 am, with still no sign of Molly, Ed called the police to let them know Molly was missing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Three hours after Molly and her mother first arrived at the pond, police called the family to inform them of her disappearance. Police initially assumed Molly might have gone off with her friends, but her family knew that was not the case as that would have been completely out of character for her.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Molly&#8217;s family began contacting Molly&#8217;s friends about her whereabouts but no one had seen or heard from her. By the afternoon, the Massachusetts state police were called in to help work the case. The pond was searched extensively by divers and boats but nothing was found. The next morning an even larger search was conducted with helicopters and neighboring communities helping to search and distribute flyers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the investigation, Magi Bish remembered something that had left her with a bad feeling. One day after dropping Molly off at the pond she remembered seeing a white car in the parking lot with a suspicious-looking man smoking in the car. She remembered feeling uncomfortable and ended up leaving the car to talk to Molly for a bit and then came back to the car and waited until the man left. A sketch of the man was created from Magi Bish&#8217;s story by police. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"413\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/molly-bish-sketck.jpg?resize=640%2C413&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1362\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/molly-bish-sketck.jpg?w=700&amp;ssl=1 700w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/molly-bish-sketck.jpg?resize=403%2C260&amp;ssl=1 403w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Police sketch of the main suspect in Molly Bish&#8217;s case (Telegram &amp; Gazette)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The sketch led to many tips, but none panned out and a search of over 100 white cars in the area was done. Ed Fett and Molly&#8217;s new boyfriend Steve Lucas were questioned, but both were not considered suspects in the end. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Police began to form a conclusion about what could have happened the day Molly went missing. They theorized that someone could have faked an injury, asking for something from the first-aid kit and when Molly bent down to open the kit, she was attacked. Comins pond also led to a fork that led to either a cemetery or a wooded area. Police believed after being attacked she was dragged up the road to the cemetery where a car could easily escape without being noticed. The theory also explained why the first-aid kit was found open and why her shoes were left behind. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Almost 3 years after her disappearance, a local hunter contacted the police because he remembered seeing a blue bathing suit in a wooded area frequented by hunters. The area was searched by police and a piece of the bathing suit was recovered. It was the same color as the bathing suit that Molly had worn the day she went missing. A DNA lab later confirmed that the material belonged to the bathing suit Molly was wearing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A massive search was done in the same area and a week after the discovery of the bathing suit, several bones were found. After testing, the bones were confirmed to be those of Molly Bish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2008 a new suspect appeared in the case, Rodney Stanger was arrested for the murder of his girlfriend. A tip had come to police linking the two cases and Rodney Stanger looked almost identical to the sketch in Molly&#8217;s case. Stangler had lived in the Warren area for years, was a hunter, and moved to Florida a year after the murder. His brother Randy also drove a white car and was known to hunt in the area where Molly&#8217;s bones were found and fished in Comins Pond. He had also moved from the area at the same time Randy left.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rodney Stanger is currently serving a 25-year sentence for the murder of his girlfriend. Molly Bish&#8217;s case is still open with no arrests being made.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Update &#8211; June 5, 2021</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Police have announced that after researching a tip they received, they have a new person of interest in the case: Francis \u201cFrank\u201d P. Sumner. Sumner is a deceased sex offender who passed away in 2016. He is known to have been active in the Spencer, Leicester, and Worcester areas from 1960 to 2016, where he operated an auto repair shop. Sumner had a lengthy criminal record which included charges of kidnapping.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/frank-sumner.jpg?resize=330%2C347&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3256\" width=\"330\" height=\"347\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/frank-sumner.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/frank-sumner.jpg?resize=248%2C260&amp;ssl=1 248w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 330px) 100vw, 330px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Francis \u201cFrank\u201d P.

		"content": {
			"rendered": "\n<p>In 2001, Ada Elaine Brown was a 41-year-old mother of two, living in Prince George, British Columbia, and was a member of the Tahltan First Nations. Ada had come from a big family and was the youngest of eight siblings and was known as the life of her family.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On April 9, Ada&#8217;s lifeless body was found in a hotel room. Within hours of her death, police determined Ada had died of natural causes. This was determined without a criminal investigation or autopsy being done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Ada&#8217;s body was brought home for her funeral, her family barely recognized her. She had been badly beaten, and had bruises on her face and two black eyes. This left many questions for the family as to how her death was determined to be of natural causes, and how police were so quick to label it that.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>She had been beaten so badly we barely reconginzed her.</p>\n<cite>Terri Brown, sister of Ada Elaine Brown (Vancouver Sun)</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Her family was suspicious of the cause of her death because Ada was known to have been in a relationship with a man who was both physically and verbally abusive towards her. Despite Ada&#8217;s sister and daughter&#8217;s attempt to stop the relationship, they were unable to get her away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Almost a year after Ada&#8217;s death, her family received an autopsy report which stated that the cause of her death was from a brain aneurysm. Her family knew that Ada had visited a doctor complaining about headaches before her death but was sent home with Tylenol and no proper examination each time. Days later, she was found dead. Terri, Ada&#8217;s sister believes if she died from a brain aneurysm, it was from being beaten.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No one has been charged with Ada Brown&#8217;s death and Ada&#8217;s family has been fighting for answers to the inconsistency and lack of investigation that was done in her death ever since. The RCMP considers the case closed.</p>\n",

She was also the mother of two young boys.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On December 23, Julie was last seen by her boss when she left work. She had told her sister-in-law that she wanted to finish some last-minute Christmas shopping, but she never returned to her apartment and was never seen or heard from again. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"536\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/julie-seay-photo.jpg?resize=640%2C536&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Julie Seay\" class=\"wp-image-957\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/julie-seay-photo.jpg?w=915&amp;ssl=1 915w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/julie-seay-photo.jpg?resize=768%2C643&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Julie Seay (NamUs)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>After police were notified of her disappearance, her blue 1988 Chevrolet&nbsp;Sprint vehicle was found in a parking space on Magnolia Ave in Daytona Beach. The car was unlocked and her purse was still inside. Julie was only 4&#8217;11 and the driver&#8217;s seat was pushed far back, adjusted for someone much taller than her to be driving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Florida Department of Law Enforcement found no evidence or clues when they searched the car. No clues were found as well when Julie&#8217;s boss&#8217;s Port Orange, Florida home was searched. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time of her disappearance, Julie Seay had recently divorced her husband but had been contemplating a reconciliation with him. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This case is still open and Julie&#8217;s family is still actively seeking answers. Police have stated that they believe foul play had a part in her disappearance.</p>\n",

			"rendered": "\n<p>In 2017, Akia Shawnta Eggleston lived in Cherry Hill, Baltimore. She was 22 years old, 8 months pregnant, and expecting her second child. Akia was unable to drive or walk long distances at the time because her pregnancy was considered high-risk, as the baby was breech and she was on bed rest.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"570\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/akia-child.jpg?resize=570%2C750&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-886\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Akia Eggleston (The Vanished)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>On May 3, 2017, an older friend (now deceased) drove Akia to a bank in Baltimore\u2019s Inner Harbor neighborhood. Akia withdrew a total of $572 and it is suspected that the money was to pay the deposit for a new apartment she planned on moving into with the father of her baby. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On May 7, a baby shower and gender reveal party had been planned for family and close friends. Akia had spent months planning the party and was looking forward to celebrating with everyone. But on the day of the party, Akia never showed up. Worried friends headed to her apartment later, only to find her not there. They reported her missing the next day.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/akia-bank.jpg?resize=640%2C360&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-879\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Akia Eggleston was captured on camera entering a bank to withdraw money (FOX Baltimore)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Akia&#8217;s disappearance was suspicious to her family from the start, her family knew she would never have left her 2-year-old daughter or family without saying anything. When police searched her apartment, it appeared that she had moved out, her bed was still there but her dresser and all her clothes had been removed from the closet. Due to her condition, Akia&#8217;s family knew it was physically impossible for her to move anything. Police interviewed Akia&#8217;s roommates and friends but no one claimed to have helped her move anything. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>There were no signs that any of us saw that she would just want to pack up and leave.</p>\n<cite>Sanobia Wilson, aunt of Akia Eggleston (CBS Baltimore)</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Cameras at her apartment complex were not working at the time, so nothing was captured. The father of Akia&#8217;s unborn son was Michael Robertson, a family friend who was someone that her family was concerned with from the beginning. He never showed up to the baby shower, never contacted anyone when she disappeared, and never helped out in the search efforts. He also had a girlfriend and multiple children at the time of her disappearance. Despite this, he was never named a person of interest by police.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a vigil held in front of her apartment, when family and friends were cleaning up, they discovered Akia&#8217;s bank card in a bush in front of her complex. The card looked to be in good condition and was never discovered by police when they initially searched her apartment, leading friends and family to suspect that it was placed there afterward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Four years later, Akia&#8217;s family is still actively searching for answers. Baltimore police believe foul play is suspected and this case remains open and unsolved. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>I don\u2019t think her case was taken seriously. I think it was viewed as she was just another black girl that\u2019s missing.</p>\n<cite>Sanobia Wilson, aunt of Akia Eggleston (CBS Baltimore)</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\" id=\"update-february-3-2022\"><strong>Update</strong> <strong>&#8211; February 3, 2022</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\">Police announced today that they have arrested Michael Robertson and charged him with the murder of Akia Eggleston.

			"rendered": "\n<p>Mary Papatsie was the youngest of eight siblings raised in Pangnirtung, Nunavut, on Baffin Island, Canada. She was a hockey and volleyball coach, who loved to fish. Mary later moved to Ottawa&#8217;s, Hintonburg neighborhood, but spent most of her time in the Vanier neighborhood.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mary Papatsie was 39 years old and a mother of 10 when she was last seen on the afternoon of April 27, 2017. She was last seen east of Ottawa&#8217;s downtown center, in the Montreal Road and Marier Street area.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/mary-papatsie-image.jpg?resize=640%2C480&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Mary Papatsie\" class=\"wp-image-824\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/mary-papatsie-image.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/mary-papatsie-image.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Mary Papatsie (The Ottawa Citizen)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Mary may have been living on the street at the time of her disappearance. She was seen frequently in the area around Montreal Road and B\u00e9gin Street.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No contact was made with family or friends since the day she disappeared and her disappearance went unreported for five weeks. Police didn&#8217;t issue their first missing persons press bulletin until June 2017.&nbsp;There were a handful of sightings that were reported to police after her disappearance, but none of the sightings were confirmed, as no one had spoken directly to her. One sighting included her being seen with two men.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mary Papatsie is approximately five feet three inches tall, weighing around 140 to 160 pounds, with long, straight brown hair, and has a scar above her left eye from a piercing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the day she disappeared, Mary may have been wearing black jogging pants, a brown T-shirt, and blue and orange flip-flop sandals. She may also have been carrying a purple and black backpack filled with other clothing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ottawa Police&#8217;s primary crime unit took over the investigation and is actively working on the case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Update</strong> <strong>&#8211; October 31, 2022</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ottawa police reported today that the human remains of Mary Papatsie were found in an under-construction three-story Vanier apartment building on Deschamps Avenue. The remains were first uncovered on September 28th and later identified to be those of Mary. The Ottawa homicide department has now taken over the investigation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sources: <br><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://ottawa.ctvnews.ca/remains-of-missing-inuk-woman-found-in-vanier-apartment-building-1.6131407\" target=\"_blank\">Remains of Inuk woman missing for 5 years found in Ottawa apartment building</a><br><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/mary-papatsie-ottawa-pangnirtung-death-memorial-1.6635707\" target=\"_blank\">Mary Papatsie mourned at makeshift memorial in Vanier</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

			"rendered": "\n<p>In July 2017, Jepsy Amaga Kallungi was living in the Philippines but decided to move to Colorado Springs for love. She wanted to marry her boyfriend, 36-year-old Dane Kallungi. The two had originally met online but their relationship was seen as &#8220;toxic&#8221; by Jepsy&#8217;s close friend Rhanae Ramos.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/jepsy-amaga-kallungi-husband.jpg?w=640&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-673\" width=\"-98\" height=\"-98\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Jepsy and Dane (Missing Persons Cases Network)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Even though Jepsy&#8217;s mother Margie Amaga lived in Hong Kong, the two remained in close contact and spoke almost three times a week via Facebook Messenger. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>March 20, 2019, would be the last time Margie would hear from Jepsy. Rhanae also received a message from Jepsy that day saying, &#8220;you&#8217;re a real person.&#8221;&nbsp;Rhanae&nbsp;then asked her if she was ok but never heard back from her.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After this message, Rhanae reached out to Dane who told her she had left Colorado to go visit friends in either Chicago or the Philippines. This prompted Rhanae to call the Colorado Springs Police Department on April 4, to ask them&nbsp;to conduct a welfare check. Police failed to make contact with Jepsy and opened a missing persons case.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Margie had also tried to contact Dane but he replied by telling her the same thing, that the last time he saw her he believed she was going to the Philippines or Chicago to visit friends. Police have stated that there was talk of them getting divorced, but that they were still together during the time of her disappearance. Dane moved to San Diego, California shortly after Jepsy went missing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Colorado Springs Homicide/Assault Unit has taken over this case, and detectives are currently investigating this disappearance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Update &#8211; June 18, 2021</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Dane Kallungi, was booked into Bernalillo County jail&nbsp;on Thursday,  June 17. He was arrested in New Mexico and charged with first-degree murder of his wife Jepsy Kallungi.  The Colorado Springs Police Department believe a domestic violence disturbance took place and Dane Kallungi strangled his wife and then buried her body. Court documents also revealed that divorce was filed for in October of 2018.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/dane-kallungi.png?resize=301%2C367&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3269\" width=\"301\" height=\"367\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Mugshot of Dane Kallungi (Bernalillo County Metropolitan Detention Center)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Colorado Springs Police say this is still an active investigation and they are now searching for her body.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sources: <br><a href=\"https://krdo.com/news/top-stories/2021/06/17/husband-of-missing-colorado-springs-woman-arrested-for-murder/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Husband of missing Colorado Springs woman arrested for murder</a><br><a href=\"https://gazette.com/news/husband-of-missing-colorado-springs-woman-arrested-on-suspicion-of-murder-court-records-show/article_c1fe5b40-cf96-11eb-aed8-f36a0d86ca2c.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Colorado Springs man arrested on suspicion of killing ex-wife, police say</a><br><a href=\"https://www.fox21news.com/top-stories/watch-police-believe-ex-husband-of-2019-missing-colorado-springs-woman-strangled-her-hid-her-body/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Fox 21 News: Police believe husband of 2019 missing Colorado Springs woman strangled her, hid her body</a></p>\n",

			"rendered": "\n<p>Ashley Loring HeavyRunner was 20 years old when she was last seen in June 2017. Although Ashley is only five feet two inches tall, a childhood friend described her as emotionally, spiritually, and physically strong. Loxi Loring, Ashley&#8217;s mother described her daughter as smart, athletic, positive, and always willing to help, someone who loved horses and the rain. Ashley is a member of the Blackfeet Indian Reservation in Montana and was enrolled in Blackfeet Community College studying environmental science. The Blackfeet reservation is expansive and spans more than 1.5 million acres, and is larger than the state of Deleware.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/ashley-loring-image.jpg?resize=640%2C349&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-510\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/ashley-loring-image.jpg?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/ashley-loring-image.jpg?resize=768%2C419&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Ashley Loring HeavyRunner (ABC News)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Ashley&#8217;s sister Kimberly first knew something was off when she returned from a trip to Morocco to visit her fianc\u00e9e. The plan had been for Kimberly to move Ashley into her apartment in nearby Missoula so they could start a new life together. Ashley never contacted her sister when she returned and any calls and messages to her phone went unanswered. Her family initially thought she could have gone to visit a family friend or lost her phone, as that had happened before, but when their father was unexpectedly hospitalized for liver failure and there was still no word from Ashley, they knew something was seriously wrong. They were a close-knit family and Ashley would have contacted them by now. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kimberly reached out to Ashley&#8217;s friends on social media to see if anyone had seen her, but none of them had been in contact with her since June 5. On that night, Ashley had contacted various friends on Facebook Messenger asking for a ride into town from her family&#8217;s ranch. Someone from the reservation posted a short video of a party that night, where Ashley was seen sitting on a couch surrounded by people drinking and chatting. Kimberly had also received a message that night from Ashley asking if she could send her some money, but she couldn&#8217;t as she was in Morocco. She asked Ashley if she was ok, to which she replied yes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kimberly soon went to Blackfeet Law Enforcement and tribal law enforcement for help, who together launched a three-day search. After the search concluded, however, they stopped their search efforts and proved to be less helpful as time went on. It would take The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) almost two months before getting seriously involved in the case.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Law enforcement did not handle Ashley&#8217;s case the way they should have. They should&#8217;ve took it serious from the get-go. They just kind of blew it off as she was of age and she&#8217;s just out there she could do what she wants.</p>\n<cite>Justin Loring, uncle of Ashley Loring</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Two weeks after Ashley was last seen, her family received their first tip: someone had seen a young woman running from a vehicle on U.S. Highway 89 on the reservation. The area is known to be desolate and is surrounded by swamps and dense forests. A search was conducted of the area, and in a nearby dump, volunteers found a gray sweater thought to have belonged to Ashley, which they handed over the sweater to the BIA to test.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/ashley-kimberly-loring.jpg?resize=640%2C480&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Ashley and Kimberly Loring\" class=\"wp-image-516\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/ashley-kimberly-loring.jpg?w=992&amp;ssl=1 992w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/ashley-kimberly-loring.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Ashley Loring HeavyRunner and her sister Kimberly (ABC News)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Feeling that her sister&#8217;s case was not being taken seriously and experiencing an overall feeling of indifference from officials, Kimberly ended up taking matters into her own hands. She conducted daily searches on the reservation and became her own detective for the case\u2014 taking phone calls, reading messages, and following up on leads. She soon discovered that the gray sweater that was found during their search had never even been sent to a crime lab, and instead, sat in a box in evidence at the BIA for months.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>If me and my family didn&#8217;t search for Ashley, I don&#8217;t think anybody would be looking for her.</p>\n<cite>Kimberly Loring, sister of Ashley Loring Heavy Runner (ABC News).</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>During one of the family&#8217;s many searches weeks after Ashley was declared missing, the family also found a tattered sweater and a pair of red-stained boots. The sweater was torn and had red stains of what appeared to be blood. The items were found on the northern edge of the reservation and not far from a house owned by a fifty-two-year-old man named Sam McDonald. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prior to her disappearance, Kimberly knew her sister had been struggling with the death of her grandfather and the breakup with her first love shortly thereafter. This had led Ashley to begin experimenting with drugs and hanging out with an older crowd, which included Sam McDonald. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sam McDonald was one of the last people Ashley Loring was with before her disappearance. Admitting that he had been partying with her for a few days, he claimed that the last time he saw Ashley was on the morning of June 11. He stated that Ashley had asked him to drive her to a pull-off in the reservation so that someone named &#8220;V-Dog&#8221; could pick her up. He remembered falling asleep in the car and when he woke up Ashley was nowhere to be seen. After looking around for her, he assumed she had gotten a ride with the man that was supposed to have picked her up, and he left the area. He was questioned and his house was searched multiple times by law enforcement but no arrests were ever made. The items of clothing they had found on his property were turned over to police to be tested, but no results have ever been released.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nearly nine months after Ashley went missing, the FBI decided to take control of the case after various leads took investigators into nearby states and off the reservation. V-Dog who is also known as Paul Valenzuela, is a man in his 50s, with a known criminal record. Paul and his then-wife Tashina Running Crane (&#8220;Tee&#8221;) were also investigated by police and had their residence searched. Paul and Tee were in a rocky marriage and Ashley&#8217;s family said that Ashley and Paul were seeing each other before her disappearance. A month after Ashely&#8217;s disappearance, Paul filed for divorce from Tee who said that she did not know about their relationship until after Ashley disappeared. To date, police have not named anyone as a suspect and no arrests have been made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kimberly Loring ended up testifying to Senate members about her experience, struggles, and the mismanagement of evidence she witnessed from law enforcement in her sister&#8217;s case. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>From the very beginning, both the Blackfeet Tribal Law Enforcement and the (Bureau of Indian Affairs) have ignored the dire situation that Ashely is in and have allowed the investigation to be handled in a dysfunctional manner. This isn\u2019t just a reality for our family but a reality for many murdered and missing indigenous women\u2019s families.</p>\n<cite>Kimberly Loring, speaking to the Senate</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Since Ashley&#8217;s disappearance, Kimberly has quit her job, moved back home, and continued to search for her sister. She has conducted more than 120 searches with little help from authorities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She continues to search for her sister each day, the case is still open and unsolved.</p>\n",

			"rendered": "\n<p>LaVena Johnson grew up in Florissant, Missouri with her father Dr. John Johnson, a service veteran, her mother Linda Johnson, and her four siblings. After high school, LaVena decided to enroll in the US Military. Her father had previously served and she wanted to continue the family tradition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>LaVena became a Private First Class in the United States Army and was stationed in Balad, Iraq. She worked in the communications building and wrote home frequently to update her parents on her experience. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/lavenajohnson.jpg?resize=640%2C360&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"LaVena Johnson\" class=\"wp-image-348\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/lavenajohnson.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/lavenajohnson.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">LaVena Johnson (St. Louis American)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>On July 17, LaVena called her parents with the good news that she would be coming home early for Christmas and that she was looking forward to decorating the tree and spending time with everyone. Her mother recalled her being her usual jubilant self during this conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A couple of days after this call, the Johnson family received a visit from a soldier. He was there to tell them that LaVena had died, even alluding that LaVena had taken her own life, which struck her family as unusual. They had just spoken to her days before, and nothing seemed to have warranted her taking her own life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As more information came in about LaVena&#8217;s death, her parents started to get a clearer picture of the events that transpired that day. LaVena got off work sometime between 4 and 5 pm but never made it to her physical training appointment. The Army claimed that LaVena had met up with a male soldier who she hung out with for approximately 4 hours in his room, and then both went to the shopping area to pick up some items before the two went their separate ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At 1:20 am her body was found in a contractor&#8217;s tent in a pool of blood with her hand covering her face. Next to her body was an M16 rile and some scattered papers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After an autopsy was done, LaVena&#8217;s death was officially ruled a suicide by the Army. They claimed she was upset that her boyfriend of two months had broken up with her and that she burned letters from him and then committed suicide by firing an M-16 automatic rifle into her mouth. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Army recommended that the family have a closed casket funeral but the Johnson family decided on an open-casket funeral, and it was here where they began to see several discrepancies with the Army&#8217;s story. For one, LaVena&#8217;s nose looked like it had been broken, and her lips cut. The only sign of a gunshot wound was a small bullet hole on the left side of her head, but the Army told them she had shot herself in the mouth. The entry wound also looked like it came from a 9MM, not an M-16 rifle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>LaVena&#8217;s gloves had also been glued onto her hands, which was not normal protocol. When LaVena&#8217;s dad finally got his hands on the autopsy report months later, he discovered more suspicious information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He discovered that no rape kit was done and no fingernail scrapings were ever taken. It was evident that the medical examiner who conducted the autopsy had already determined that the cause of death was a suicide beforehand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At this point, the family decided to hire their own criminal investigator to look into the case. After months of back-and-forth with the Army, they were finally given the case documents, which included original color crime scene photos. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The photos showed that LaVena had severe damage to her face, resembling someone who had been hit with a blunt object. Her nose was broken, she had a black eye and loose teeth, and some type of corrosive liquid had been poured into her genitals, most likely to destroy any DNA evidence. The gunshot wound was also inconsistent with suicide. LaVena&#8217;s father did not believe his 5-foot-1 daughter&#8217;s arms were long enough to pull the trigger of an M-16 cradled between her legs, as described in the Army&#8217;s report. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Army said they did not do a rape kit because it did not look like there was any evidence of a struggle. Even though there was no suicide note, no recovered bullet, no significant gunshot residue on her hands, and a trail of blood found outside the tent\u2014the Army claimed that she was depressed and unstable days before her death and that her death was a suicide, and closed the case.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"378\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/lavena-johnson-father.jpg?resize=640%2C378&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-344\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/lavena-johnson-father.jpg?w=795&amp;ssl=1 795w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/lavena-johnson-father.jpg?resize=300%2C177&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/lavena-johnson-father.jpg?resize=768%2C454&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">LaVena Johnson and her father, John Johnson (The Sleuth Journal)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>LaVena&#8217;s father, John Johnson believes his daughter was assaulted and killed, and her crime scene was staged to look like a suicide to cover up for somebody on that base with high rank or prestige. The Johnsons are not the only ones fighting this uphill battle. Several families have lost daughters in the Military to mysterious deaths and &#8220;suicides.&#8221; In many cases, they are left with unanswered questions, unrealistic conclusions, and a lifelong fight for the truth from the Military. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below you can find some ways to help, and resources to dig deeper into LaVena&#8217;s case and other instances of military injustice.</p>\n",

			"rendered": "\n<p>On February 13, 2000, Asha Jaquilla Degree was 9 years old and lived with her father Howard, mother Iquilla and her brother O&#8217;Bryant (10 years old) in Shelby, North Carolina. Asha and her brother&#8217;s life were centered around their extended family, church, and school. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"396\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/asha-degree.jpg?resize=640%2C396&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-482\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/asha-degree.jpg?w=1753&amp;ssl=1 1753w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/asha-degree.jpg?resize=768%2C475&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/asha-degree.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Asha Jaquilla Degree (The Charlotte Observer)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>On that day, there was a car crash near the Degree house that caused the power in the neighborhood to go out. Their normal routine of taking a bath before bed was left to be done the next morning. The kids went to bed at 8:30 p.m. and Iquilla set the alarm for an hour earlier the next morning so the children could bathe before going to school.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At 12:30 am the power had come back on, and Asha&#8217;s father Howard came home from work. He checked on the children and watched TV before going to bed at 2:30 am. He checked on the children one last time before going to bed, where he saw them both sleeping. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the night, Asha&#8217;s brother O&#8217;Bryant momentarily woke up and saw her standing in their room. Thinking she had just gone to use the restroom, he goes back to bed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Iquilla&#8217;s alarm went off at 5:30 am, she rose to give the children their bath. She opened the door to the children&#8217;s room and saw O&#8217;Bryant in bed, but no Asha. She searched the entire house but was unable to locate her. She realized Asha was not in the house and went to wake Howard to tell him she was missing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After calling family members, they called the police shortly afterward as no one had seen her. When the police came to the house, they saw no evidence of a crime, foul play, or forced entry. After police realized that Asha&#8217;s backpack, a pair of sneakers and two sets of clothes were missing, they started to think Asha left by choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Asha&#8217;s parents were adamant that she would not have run away. Her home life was stable and she was a shy girl, terrified of the dark, storms, and dogs, and there was a storm the night she went missing. She had lost a basketball game recently, and was visibly upset about it &#8211; but they believe it would not have been a reason for her to run away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After police made her disappearance public, sightings of her started to come in. Between 3:45 and 4:15 am a truck driver and a motorist claimed to have seen a young girl walking south along Highway 18 in the direction of town. The girl was wearing a long-sleeved white T-shirt and white pants, which police confirmed were missing from Asha&#8217;s closet. Unfortunately, at the time of seeing her, they did not call the police to report it until seeing a TV segment about her later. The motorist claimed when he saw her, he turned his car around to ask if she needed any help but she became frightened when he approached her and she ran off into some trees by the side of the road.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another lead came in on February 15. In a shed along the highway that belonged to a business, a woman told police she found a Micky Mouse hair bow, a green marker, and a pencil inside the shed. Police searched the shed and found candy wrappers that were confirmed to be the same kind that Asha had gotten the weekend before, in a basketball tournament. Unfortunately, police were unable to do much with the lead, and it wasn&#8217;t until 18 months later that another one came in. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On August 3, 2001, twenty-six miles from her house, and in a different direction than the one she was seen walking in the night of her disappearance, a contractor found a black trash bag that had been buried on his property. He opened the bag only to see another black trash bag and when he opened the second one, he found a child&#8217;s backpack with Asha&#8217;s name and telephone number written on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Police searched the property but were unable to find anything else significant. They did find a pair of men&#8217;s khaki pants but no public information was ever released from the DNA testing of them. After Asha&#8217;s backpack was discovered, police officially made an announcement that they believed foul play was a factor in Asha&#8217;s disappearance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In May of 2016, a new tip came in where a witness saw Asha getting into a dark green 1975 Ford Thunderbird or a 1973 Lincoln Continental Mark IV along Highway 18 the night she went missing.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1197\" height=\"350\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/asha-cars.jpg?fit=792%2C231&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-146\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/asha-cars.jpg?w=1197&amp;ssl=1 1197w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/asha-cars.jpg?resize=300%2C88&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/asha-cars.jpg?resize=768%2C225&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/asha-cars.jpg?resize=1024%2C299&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">1975 Ford Thunderbird on left, 1973 Lincoln Continental Mark IV on the right (WBTV)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>In October 2018, police made a new plea for information regarding two items.

			"rendered": "\n<p>Amber Alyssa Tuccaro from Mikisew Cree First Nation was 21 years old and living in Alberta, Canada where she lived with her mother Tootsie and young son Jacob. On August 17, 2010, Amber flew to Edmonton from Fort McMurray with her 14-month son and a female friend for a weekend trip. Their plan was to spend the night outside the city to save money, then head into Edmonton the next day.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/amber-tuccaro.jpg?resize=600%2C750&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1904\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/amber-tuccaro.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/amber-tuccaro.jpg?resize=208%2C260&amp;ssl=1 208w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Amber Tuccaro and her son Jacob (Alberta Press)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>On the day of their arrival, Amber decided that she wanted to go into the city that night. She left her son with her friend and decided to hitchhike there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Amber failed to return the next day, her friend called her mother, who then contacted the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) to report her missing. Tootsie told the media that the RCMP did not take Amber&#8217;s disappearance seriously. The RCMP publicly stated that they thought she was alive and somewhere in the Edmonton area and told her that she was probably out partying and would eventually re-appear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two years after the RCMP was contacted, a piece of evidence was released and the RCMP then declared they believed Amber had been murdered. The evidence was a portion of a phone call that Amber had made while in a car with the man suspected of murdering her. Listen to the audio below (CBC News) or <a aria-label=\"read the transcript of the call (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/ab/community-communaute/historical-homicide-groupe-non-resolues/amber-tuccaro-eng.htm\" target=\"_blank\">read the transcript of the call here</a> (scroll halfway down the page).</p>\n\n\n\n<br><br><iframe style=\"width:100%; height:400px;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/E7dL1Qro46g\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n\n\n\n<p>In the call, we can hear the man insisting that he is driving north to 50th street. Amber repeats what the man is saying, while still questioning if they are actually going in the correct direction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The RCMP believe that instead of driving Amber north into the city where she wanted to go, \u200athe man actually drove her south-east along rural country roads. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On September 1, 2012, horseback riders found partial skeletal remains on a farmer&#8217;s field near Leduc County. The remains were discovered to be Amber&#8217;s &#8212; the area was just south of her motel. It was also discovered that even though only a minute of the phone call was released, the actual phone call was 17 minutes in length. That was also the exact length of time it took to drive from her motel to the area where her remains were found.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The RCMP had obtained the call in the first place because the person Amber was on the phone with was her incarcerated brother and the facility where he was at had started recording all outgoing calls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two women have come forward since the recording was released and told RCMP they recognized the man&#8217;s voice heard on the recording.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>I know that voice. I\u2019ve ridden with that voice before on several occasions. There\u2019s no doubt in my mind that it\u2019s his voice.</p>\n<cite><em>Woman telling CBC news of the recording police released (CBC News)</em></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite these leads, RCMP have said they looked into the man but have ruled him out as a person of interest in the investigation.

			"rendered": "\n<p>In 2001, Alissa Turney was 17 years old and a junior in high school living with her stepsister Sarah and stepfather Michael Turney. Alissa&#8217;s mother had passed away and Michael&#8217;s three older boys were living out of the house. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each sister had a very different relationship with their father. Michael was a cool, laid-back dad with Sarah, but with Alissa, he was uptight, strict, and monitored her whereabouts. He told Sarah he did this because Alissa needed more guidance and direction in life. Tensions between Alissa and her stepfather were always high.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"531\" height=\"411\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/alissa-friends.webp?resize=531%2C411&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4226\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/alissa-friends.webp?w=531&amp;ssl=1 531w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/alissa-friends.webp?resize=336%2C260&amp;ssl=1 336w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 531px) 100vw, 531px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Alissa Turney and friends (East Valley Tribune)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>When Alissa was around her friends, she was a completely different person than when she was around her family. She just radiated when she was out and about with friends, and it seems like that, that energy that she had kind of got sucked back in when she went into her home.</p>\n<cite>Katie Rothweiler, grade school friend of Alissa Turney (ABC News)</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>May 17, 2001, was the last day of school before summer break and that day Alissa&#8217;s sister Sarah was on an end-of-year retreat at Water World. Michael failed to show up after school to pick Sarah up at 3 pm though. Sarah ended up walking to a friend&#8217;s house to wait for him. Sometime in the evening her father finally arrived to pick her up and informed her that Alissa was missing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sarah used her father&#8217;s phone to try to contact Alissa on the way home but couldn&#8217;t reach her. At the house, Michael had Sarah check Alissa&#8217;s bedroom. There she found the contents of Alissa&#8217;s backpack scattered on her bed and her cellphone on top of her dresser. Her cell phone was next to a note, which read:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p><em>Dad and Sarah, <br>When you dropped me off at school today, I decided I really am going to California. Sarah, you said you really wanted me gone &#8211; now you have it. Dad, I took $300 from you. That&#8217;s why I saved my money.</em></p>\n<cite>Note from Alissa Turney to her sister Sarah and father Michael</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This was not surprising to Sarah at first because Alissa actually did have an aunt in California who she had recently talked about going to live with, as she had not been getting along with their father.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That night, Michael, who use to be a police officer himself, called the police department to report Alissa as a runaway. Police opened a missing person&#8217;s file but no investigation or follow-up was done, as Michael claimed she was a runaway and that he knew her location was in California.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A week after Alissa disappeared, Michael told police he received a call from her early in the morning between 4 to 5 am from Riverside, California. On the call, Alissa apparently told him she was unhappy with her life, blamed him as the reason she left, and then hung up. Police were never able to verify the call and were unable to obtain a copy of the recording. Michael had a home recording system but had told the police it was not on at the time of the call because of the early hour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the years after her disappearance, Michael started telling family and those close to Alissa that he thought something terrible had happened to her. He thought someone might have been following her or caused harm to her and since the police were not doing anything he had to search for her himself. Michael would even make several trips to California to search and pass out missing person flyers of Alissa.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"464\" height=\"525\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/mike-turney.jpg?resize=464%2C525&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Michael Turney (East Valley Tribune)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>In 2006, several years after Alissa disappeared, the police got a lead from a man named Thomas Hymer. Hymer was in a Florida prison serving time for murder and sent police a letter confessing to Alissa&#8217;s murder. Police eventually realized the letter was a hoax, \u200abut during their investigation, they noticed things were not adding up with Michael&#8217;s initial story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the 7 years since Alissa had gone missing, she had not contacted a single one of her friends or anyone in her family, including the aunt she was supposed to live with. The $1,800 she initially had in her bank was still there, untouched. Her social security number was also never used, meaning she had never gotten a job or gone to school. It became clear to the police that this was not a runaway case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Police learned that the day Alissa went missing, she was not in school the entire day. Michael had picked her up from school near lunchtime, which was confirmed by her boyfriend John, who said Alissa had told him she was leaving early but would see him later that evening at an end-of-year party. Many of her friends also claimed that she told them she would see them later that night at the party.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michael&#8217;s version of the story was that he picked her up to get lunch and when they arrived home, they got into a fight about house rules, which ended with her storming off to her room and him leaving to run errands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Police also discovered Michael was a very meticulous and paranoid man. He had documented every incoming and outgoing call to the house and had cameras placed outside of his property. There was even a hidden camera in the vent of the living room. When police asked for the videotapes of the day of Alissa&#8217;s disappearance, Michael told them he reviewed them and there was nothing to see. When they ask for the audiotapes of that day, he told them that unfortunately on that day the recorder had been turned off, so nothing was recorded. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At this point, police had enough probable cause to search the house. While doing so, investigators came across twenty-six homemade pipe bombs and a 90-page manifesto written by Michael. In the manifesto, Michael claimed that Alissa had run away, but he believed she was followed by two men from the electrical union he used to work for. During his time at the electrical union, he was a whistleblower and he believed that the men took revenge on him by murdering Alissa. He then avenged her death by killing the two men (the men he was referring to were found to have died of natural causes).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Police also recovered tons of paperwork and hundreds of hours of audio and videotapes but were still unable to find anything from the day Alissa went missing. Letters were found where Alissa claimed to have been molested by Michael and parent-child contracts were found, which Alissa had signed to agree that she had never been sexually assaulted. Friends, her boyfriend, and a teacher, later confirmed hearing about these allegations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After interviewing Alissa&#8217;s friends, police learned from one friend that Alissa had confided in him that her father had tried sexually abusing her when she was younger. He had picked her up early one day from school and driven to a secluded area where he attempted to fool around with her. She also told her friend that he got aggressive. Another friend told police that one time Alissa awoke to her father trying to gag her with a sock. Michael Turney has denied all of these allegations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michael Turney ended up pleading guilty and served ten years in prison for the twenty-six pipe bombs. He was also declared to have a paranoid personality disorder and required to participate in mental health treatments.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:32px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>UPDATE \u2013 June 9, 2020</strong>:</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sarah Turney announced in a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.voicesforjusticepodcast.com/podcast/episode/3fcfdbd3/case-update\" target=\"_blank\">case update from her Voices for Justice podcast</a>, that the Phoenix police department are submitting Alissa&#8217;s case to the prosecutor&#8217;s office for charges against Michael Turney.

		"content": {
			"rendered": "\n<p>Amy Tirador was 29 years old and a 10-year military veteran when she arrived at Camp Caldwell on August 14, 2009. The camp was located in western Iraq, near the Iranian border and Amy was one of only a handful of women stationed there. Originally trained as a medic during her previous deployments, she began training for a position in human intelligence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amy and her husband Mickey Tirador had been married for three years at the time and had even bought a house near the base in Washington. They hoped to start a family when their tour ended. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"798\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/amy-tirador-mickey.jpg?resize=640%2C798&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-423\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Mickey and Amy Tirador (Times Union)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Known as a hard worker with a positive attitude, Amy was sent to Arizona in the spring of 2009 for interrogation training. Her time there was not as successful as she had hoped, and she failed to meet the standards needed for the position. Frustrated, Amy ended up returning to camp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She received some good news shortly after. Despite being married, she and her husband Mickey&#8217;s military obligations had caused them to live apart. But on October 9, Mickey arrived at camp to begin work there, and they both began sharing a containerized housing unit (CHU). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several colleagues and various people who worked with Amy at the time stated that stress and job difficulties soon began mounting for her after Mickey arrived. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On November 3, Amy went to work, and near the end of her shift, she received an email from her supervisor who stated her job performance was unsatisfactory. He ordered her to expedite several reports that were late. She left work at 5:30 pm and returned to her CHU. Mickey was the last person to see Amy that night at 8 pm. She was leaving their CHU to walk to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At 5 am the next morning, Mickey did not see Amy when he woke up. Assuming she had left for work &#8211; he went to the gym. After the gym, he ran some errands and went to look for her. Around lunchtime, a major met with him to tell him that something had happened to Amy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amy Tirador was found dead at 1:29 pm on November 4, by a private contractor during a maintenance check. He noticed a door ajar, with a boot protruding from a room. The room was just large enough to fit a generator, and when he entered he found a uniformed and bloodied female slumped against the generator. There was a 9mm handgun by her right hand, a single gunshot wound behind her right ear, and two visible pools of blood in the room. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Army initially labeled her death \u201cundetermined\u201d, but investigators have since concluded Amy died by suicide as they found Amy&#8217;s fingerprints on the handgun. DNA of another person was also found on the gun, but the person was never identified. Mickey was tested but did not match the DNA. The police believed the additional DNA found on the gun, may have come from someone responding to the crime. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To this day, the Army maintains that Amy was at &#8220;high risk&#8221; for suicide because she was experiencing mounting pressures at work and her marriage was less than ideal. Police had searched Mickey&#8217;s computer and found evidence of him on dating websites, Amy&#8217;s mother Colleen Murphy also said Amy was planning on divorcing him.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"272\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/amy-photo-long.png?resize=640%2C272&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-418\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/amy-photo-long.png?w=1706&amp;ssl=1 1706w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/amy-photo-long.png?resize=768%2C327&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/amy-photo-long.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Amy Tirador (amytirador.blogspot.com)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The family has said they believe her death was an execution-style murder and took place in the generator room as the generator would muffle the shot of a gunshot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A female soldier and good friend had also called Amy very &#8220;positive and religious.&#8221; Amy went to church almost every Sunday on the base, never used drugs or alcohol, and she saw no evidence of a planned suicide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mickey Tirador also maintained that his wife would never have killed herself. He hired a forensic pathologist to exhume Amy&#8217;s body for further investigation but no findings were ever released.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the Tiradors, several families have lost daughters in the Military to mysterious deaths and &#8220;suicides&#8221;. In many cases, they are left with unanswered questions, unrealistic conclusions, and a lifelong fight for the truth from the Military. </p>\n",

He left his car soon after to go search for them, walking the same path they would have walked. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At 4:00 pm, with no sight of the girls, he called Libby&#8217;s grandmother and Abby&#8217;s mother to ask for help in his search for the girls. With both families searching, they were still unable to locate the girls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At 5:30 pm, the police were called, and soon a full search was underway. Around the same time, Libby&#8217;s phone went dead. The search concluded that night with no answers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next morning the search resumed with canines, divers, and the FBI. Around noon, the bodies of two girls were found by a volunteer searcher near the edge of the water of Deer Creek. Deer Creek was approximately half a mile from where Libby&#8217;s last Snapchat was taken. The area was part of a private 40-acre lot belonging to a 70-year-old man (he was eventually ruled out as a suspect).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next day, autopsies were completed and the two bodies were confirmed to be of Abby and Libby. No other information was given by the police on how they died, but a photo of a man is released by them to the public. At the time, they did not name him as a suspect, just someone they wanted to interview, as he was seen on the trail at the same time as the girls.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"355\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com//wp-content/uploads/2019/05/delphi-suspect.png?resize=640%2C355&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-76\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/delphi-suspect.png?w=692&amp;ssl=1 692w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/delphi-suspect.png?resize=300%2C166&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The photo released by police of the man they wanted to interview (inquisitr.com)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>A week later, the police and FBI hold a press conference to give more details on the case. They revealed that the photo of the man was taken from Libby&#8217;s own phone. They also released a small audio clip taken from the phone. In the clip, the man can be heard saying &#8220;Down the hill&#8221;. Circumstances of why the video was taken was and is still a mystery. Police have openly stated they think it was a conscious decision by Libby to film the man because she may have sensed that something was not right. </p>\n\n\n\n<br><iframe style=\"width:100%; height:400px;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/S-h5_I2Ofd0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n\n\n\n<p>On July 17, police released a sketch of what the suspect could look like:</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"426\" height=\"435\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com//wp-content/uploads/2019/05/delphi-suspect-sketch.jpg?resize=426%2C435&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-78\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/delphi-suspect-sketch.jpg?w=426&amp;ssl=1 426w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/delphi-suspect-sketch.jpg?resize=294%2C300&amp;ssl=1 294w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Original police sketch of the possible suspect (Inside Edition)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>To date, the only person of interest to be named is Daniel Nations.

There were two other names that were connected to the case: John Miller, 59, of Fort Wayne, Indiana (now serving 80 years in prison for the death of April Tinsley) and Charles Andrew Eldridge, 46 (arrested after arranging sex with an undercover cop posing as an underage girl). In the end, police removed both these names from their suspect list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On April 22, 2019, police held a press conference stating that the case was going in a &#8220;new direction&#8221;.

			"rendered": "\n<p>Holly Alcott White was 49 years old and living in Taos, New Mexico in 2016. She went missing just a few months before her 50th birthday. Holly had been the manager at the Taos Center for the Arts for 22 years but was preparing to relocate to Albuquerque, New Mexico. Her husband Jeff White had just started a new job there, and Holly was about to start one as the office manager at a dentist&#8217;s office. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"369\" height=\"449\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/holly-white-photo.jpg?resize=369%2C449&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-620\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Holly Alcott White (Find Holly White FB)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>On Thursday night, May 5, 2016, Holly came home from work and spoke to her husband and best friend Jill Gustafson. Jill said that although Holly seemed stressed about the move, she was still her cheerful self. She was last heard from at 9:20 pm. According to Jeff, their conversation was cheerful and nothing seemed amiss, as they had planned for Jeff to come into town the following day for a farewell party the TAC had planned for her.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next morning on May 6, Holly was scheduled to meet a close friend, Cynthia Arvidson, to go on their daily morning walk with Holly&#8217;s dog Rosie. The two had walked together every morning for 8 years. However, Holly failed to show up that morning. Concerned about her whereabouts, Cynthia, who had keys to Holly&#8217;s house as she often house sat for her when she was away, went to Holly&#8217;s house. Inside the house, Cynthia found Holly&#8217;s purse and cell phone in the kitchen and Rosie sitting inside waiting to be walked. The only thing that was missing from the house was Holly&#8217;s car.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>None of it made any sense. Holly always had her purse with her. And she would never leave her dog. That dog Rosie, she was like her child.</p>\n<cite>Cynthia Arvidson, friend of Holly Alcott (NBC News)</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Later that day, her blue Ford Escape was found parked at the Rio Grande Gorge Bridge parking lot, which was 10 miles west of Taos and spanned the entire Taos Gorge. Her keys were still in the car&#8217;s cup holder and a vendor at the bridge said that the car was already there when she arrived at 6:15 am. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A week after Holly&#8217;s disappearance, Law Enforcement with the help of a dive team and river raft guides, searched 12 miles of the R\u00edo Grande Gorge. They found no body, but did find a women&#8217;s black Skechers shoe floating in the water. Some of Holly&#8217;s friends said the shoe belonged to her, but theories have also come up that someone may have hurled it into the river to confuse investigators. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jeff was not considered to be a suspect in the case, as he was in Albuquerque that night, passed a polygraph test, and their marriage by all accounts seemed to be a stable and happy one. Holly and Jeff had been together for 27 years and married for 20 of those years.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"400\" height=\"575\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/holly-white-husband.jpg?resize=400%2C575&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-619\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Holly White and her husband Jeff White (Santa Fe New Mexican)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The family and all of Holly&#8217;s close friends maintained that she would not have committed suicide without leaving a note, or left without telling anyone. If she had jumped from the bridge, her body would have been found by divers, as an extensive search was done after her disappearance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>New Mexico State Police pulled fingerprints from Holly&#8217;s car, one from the rearview mirror, and one from the passenger side door, but both were insufficient in leading to any identification.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Holly&#8217;s father Ray Alcott has hired the family&#8217;s own private investigator, Elaine Graves, to look into Holly&#8217;s disappearance and she is still actively working on the case with her partner. </p>\n",

Rosenda was known to be very outgoing and someone who loved to laugh and who people knew by her unique laugh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rosenda lived with her sister Cissy Reyes. On October 2, Cissy lent Rosenda some money and an acquaintance picked her up from their house. The two drove the short distance to Legends Casino in Toppenish, Washington in an older model Nissan. Rosenda was wearing blue jeans and her sister&#8217;s pink Nike sweater.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rosenda was last seen that night in the casino by her aunt playing the slot machines. Rosenda hugged and greeted her aunt seemed bubbly overall. At around midnight, she was last seen leaving the casino with a man, seemingly voluntarily. Rosenda was not seen or heard from again. </p>\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>UPDATE</strong> &#8211; July 12, 2019</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Almost 9 months after her disappearance, on July 4, 2019, two homeless men found human remains in an unplugged freezer. The freezer was located in the 64000 block of U.S. Highway 97 on the Yakama Reservation and dental records confirmed that the remains were those of Rosenda Strong.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The police are now actively investigating Rosenda&#8217;s disappearance as a homicide. </p>\n",

Initially&nbsp;apprehensive of going out to sea for the trip even though she was a strong swimmer and trained lifeguard, she put her worries aside and the family decided to go and have a great time.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"338\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/amy-bradley-family.jpg?resize=640%2C338&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-190\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/amy-bradley-family.jpg?w=700&amp;ssl=1 700w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/amy-bradley-family.jpg?resize=300%2C159&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The Bradley family (filmdaily.co)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>On March 21, 1988, Amy, her parents Ron and Iva, and her brother Brad (21-years-old) boarded the Royal Caribbean cruise ship: <em>The Rhapsody</em> in Puerto Rico traveling to Cura\u00e7ao, Antilles. A typical cruise ship, housing more than 2,000 people, the family had a great time on their first night. On the second night, the family got dressed up to have a fancy dinner. A photo of Brad and Amy was taken by the cruise ship photographer and can be seen below:&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/box5511.temp.domains/~thehuean/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/amy-lynn-bradley-brother-1.jpg?resize=640%2C427\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-16\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/amy-lynn-bradley-brother-1.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/amy-lynn-bradley-brother-1.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/amy-lynn-bradley-brother-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The last known still photograph of Amy taken before her disappearance (Investigation Discovery)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>After dinner, the family headed to the upper deck of the ship for a party. At 1 am, Amy\u2019s parents retreated to bed and Amy and Brad headed to the ship\u2019s nightclub.&nbsp;At 3:30 am. Brad left the club and headed back to their room, leaving Amy at the club. Amy returned to their room shortly after, and the two talked for a bit about plans for the next day. Brad then headed to bed, leaving Amy alone on the balcony.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amy\u2019s Dad woke up sometime before sunrise and briefly saw Amy sitting on the balcony as his room was in their eyesight. When he woke up again sometime later around 6 am,  he noticed Amy was no longer sitting on the balcony. Ron got up and went to their room to find Brad sleeping, but not Amy. He noticed Amy\u2019s shoes still in the room but not her cigarettes or lighter. Thinking Amy was up and around the ship, Ron went to look for her.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During that time, the ship was en route to being docked in Cura\u00e7ao. Ron went to alert his wife about Amy after failing to find her. The family asked the crew to make an announcement that they were looking for Amy but the ship refused, as they did not want to panic other passengers.&nbsp;After pleading to ship officials to not let any passengers off\u200a\u2014\u200athe ship docked, as officials didn&#8217;t want to disappoint the thousands of passengers aboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ship officials conducted their own \u201csearch\u201d of the ship but found nothing. They told the family that the planned schedule must be kept too and that if more time was needed on the island, the family should stay behind to do what was necessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Bradley family decided to stay in Cura\u00e7ao where they contacted the American Embassy for help. The FBI became involved as well. The FBI learned that a thorough search had actually not been done by the cruise, only the common areas were scanned. The FBI and family then flew to meet the ship at their next stop, so they could re-board and investigate further.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A cruise video promoter gave the FBI footage he had taken at the nightclub that night, which included footage of Amy dancing and holding hands with a man named Allister Douglas, or Yellow. He was a member of the ship\u2019s band: Blue Orchid (<a aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=35&amp;v=DqzW5QNmxk4\" target=\"_blank\">see all the clips of Amy from this video here</a>). Two girls also said they saw Allister and Amy together at 5:30 a.m. leaving an elevator to go back into the club. Allister was brought in for questioning, passed a polygraph, and was not deemed a person of interest.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"366\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/box5511.temp.domains/~thehuean/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/amy-lynn-bradley-vanishes-from-cruise-ship-3-1.jpg?resize=640%2C366\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-17\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/amy-lynn-bradley-vanishes-from-cruise-ship-3-1.jpg?w=700&amp;ssl=1 700w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.thehueandcry.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/amy-lynn-bradley-vanishes-from-cruise-ship-3-1.jpg?resize=300%2C171&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Video of Amy dancing with Yellow at the ship nightclub (boredomtherapy.com)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The questioning of Allister caused Brad to remember an odd encounter with him though. The morning Amy went missing, Allister had come up to him and told him he was sorry about the disappearance of his sister. Brad began to question how he would have even known Amy was missing, as her disappearance wasn&#8217;t public at that point. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amy\u2019s mom also remembered an odd event that happened during dinner on the night of her disappearance. The cruise photographer took photos of all the patrons and then posted them for sale outside of the restaurant and every single photo that Amy was in, was missing from the board. The photographer told the family he precisely remembered printing them, but to this day it is unknown who took those photos, or why they were missing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The FBI investigation of the ship did not lead to any arrests and the ship ended up docking and letting everyone off. Brad and Ron went back to Cura\u00e7ao to search for Amy several times, but with no success. America\u2019s Most Wanted did a special on Amy \u200awhich ended up bringing in new leads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In August of 1998, 5 months after Amy went missing, Canadian computer engineer David Carmichael was on a beach in Cura\u00e7ao where he saw a girl being walked by two very tough-looking men.&nbsp;\u201cShe looked frightened like she was about to say something when one of the guys motioned her away and gave me a menacing look,\u201d says Carmichael who initially thought nothing of the interaction, until he saw America\u2019s Most Wanted. He even flew to Virginia to meet the Bradleys. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>I am haunted by that encounter with Amy. I know it was her.</p>\n<cite>David Carmichael, diver who spotted Amy on a beach on Cura\u00e7ao (People Magazine)</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>He also recalled seeing two very distinct tattoos on the woman\u2014a gecko and Tasmanian devil. Amy had those exact tattoos. The FBI immediately sent people to the island to look for her but were unable to find anything on the island.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During this time, the family hired their own private investigator to work the case\u200a\u2014\u200aI am not going to go into too much detail in this, as the family ended up getting scammed by this &#8220;investigator&#8221; for more than $100,000 (he did end up getting prosecuted for fraud and was forced to pay the family back their money, but so much time had already been lost).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The case remained cold until May 2002 when a member of the Navy was in Cura\u00e7ao at a brothel. A woman had noticed him speaking English and came up to him pleading for help before she was led away by brothel workers. At the time confused, he told her there was a Navy ship close by that could help, but he never reported the encounter as he was on active duty, feared repercussions, and didn&#8217;t know anyone was missing. By the time he reported the sighting years later, the brothel had been burned to the ground.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was another potential sighting in 2005 when a witness named Judy Maurer claimed to have seen Amy in a department store restroom in Barbados. Judy claimed she was in a restroom when a woman entered with a couple of men. The men threatened her if she did not follow through on a deal. When the men left, she approached the woman and the woman told her that her&nbsp;first name was Amy and that she was from Virginia before she was taken away by the men.

Alyssa told her grandmother she was coming home to be with her mother. She never arrived, however, and her mother died three days later never having said goodbye to her daughter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the family isn&#8217;t clear on the timeline, they did file a missing person&#8217;s report but were told by police that nothing could be done until 24 hours had passed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next day, on the evening of April 10th at 9:15 pm, a 10-second phone call was made to 911 from Alyssa&#8217;s phone. The dispatcher heard a woman frantically asking for help, but the line went dead before she could respond.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The police tried to track the call but were unable to do so successfully, as the phone did not have a GPS tracker. They believed the call was made in Kent and confirmed on 911 call records that the phone number belonged to Alyssa. The phone went out of service a few days later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two sightings of Alyssa on the day she disappeared were eventually reported. One witness spotted her near 30th Avenue South and Kent-Des Moines Road on Kent\u2019s West Hill, where she was approached by a green 1990s model pickup truck. The witness believed the truck had an out-of-state license plate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another witness told police Alyssa was with a Caucasian man in his 50s or 60s, about 5 feet 8 inches tall and 175 to 185 pounds. The man reportedly drove a green pickup and it appeared that they were familiar with one another.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Police are still searching for any information regarding Alyssa&#8217;s disappearance and the case remains open and unsolved.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Every single time there&#8217;s a body found on the news, there&#8217;s a pause. It&#8217;s literally like you&#8217;re dead for a moment because you have to wonder, \u2018Is it Alyssa?\u2019 I think I&#8217;ve called the coroner more than anybody should in a lifetime.</p>\n<cite>Tina Russell, aunt of Alyssa McLemore (theworld.org)</cite></blockquote>\n",

She came from a family of five: her mother Maribel Valles, step-father Carlos Gomez, sister Maribel, and brothers Fernando and Jesus. Melissa was known as a good student who graduated from Eagle Pass High School with honors and played on the school basketball team. Even though Melissa had two older brothers, her sister Maribel recalled her taking on the role of head of household.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>She was petite, but she was a really tough lady. She really put people in their place. She did that since she was a girl. She would put little boys who were bullies in their place.</p>\n<cite>Maribel Valles, sister of Melissa Valles (Associated Press)</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2003, Melissa was 26 years old and was with the headquarters detachment of the 64th Forward Support Battalion, 3rd Brigade Combat Team stationed in Balad, Iraq. She had been stationed there for roughly three months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Wednesday, July 9, 2003, Melissa Valles died from a non-combat gunshot wound to the abdomen. She became the second U.S. servicewoman to die in Iraq.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Military officials have said the death was accidental but did not release any information or details of the wound to the family. The Valles family was left mainly with unanswered questions in Melissa&#8217;s death and have stated that although they have gotten updates from the Army, they have never received a conclusion. To this day, they still seek answers as to how Melissa died and the circumstances around it.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>She sacrificed her life and served her country real proudly. For them to pay us back this way, it&#8217;s not fair. It&#8217;s not fair to her.

			"rendered": "\n<p>Tina Priest was 20 years old and from Smithville, Texas. She was certified as a medical assistant and decided to join the Army shortly after. She served as an Army Private First Class on a military base known as Camp Taji in Iraq. She was assigned to the 5th Support Battalion, lst Brigade Combat Team and 4th Infantry Division in Fort Hood, Texas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On February 15, 2006, Tina accused a fellow soldier of sexually assaulting her. She underwent medical examinations, but they were inconclusive of an assault. On February 27, she was deemed &#8220;stable with no risk management issues&#8221; and was prescribed 48 hours of rest due to exhaustion by an Army clinical psychologist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On March 1, two weeks after reporting her sexual assault, Tina Priest was found dead in her room. She had died of an M-16 gunshot wound to her chest. The Army ruled the death a suicide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tina&#8217;s family disputed the Army&#8217;s suicide claim from the start. How could their petite 5-foot-tall daughter physically have shot herself with the M-16 rifle with her short arm length? The Army claimed that Tina used her toe to pull the trigger to kill herself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Army also claimed that Tina was suicidal and had trouble coping with her assault. Joy Priest, Tina&#8217;s mother said that the two spoke on the phone and exchanged emails frequently after her assault and that if anything, she was angry but not suicidal. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It took the Army almost six months to provide Tina&#8217;s family with investigative documents, and then nine more months for them to release photos of the autopsy and death scene.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>They have you jump through hoops, then they back you up and make you jump through more. It\u2019s so painful &#8212; just mind-bending. </p>\n<cite>Joy Priest &#8211; Tina Priest&#8217;s mother (The Los Angeles Times)</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The Army never investigated Tina Priest&#8217;s death as a homicide, only as a suicide. Rape charges against the soldier who Tina accused of raping her were dropped a few weeks after her death, even though his sperm was found on her sleeping bag. He was convicted of failure to obey an order and sentenced to forfeiture of $714 for 2 months, 30 days restriction to the base, and 45 days of extra duty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> Tina Priest&#8217;s case is no longer under investigation by the Army, but her family is still fighting for the truth.</p>\n",
